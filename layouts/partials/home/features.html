      <h2>Create AAA games and 3D visualizations</h2>
      <p>O3DE has been developed by the community for cutting-edge photorealistic graphics and complex, real-time interactions. 
        Build deep player experiences using the visual scripting tools provided with Script Canvas, and deliver your product to multiple platforms, 
        from top-shelf gaming PCs to mobile devices. Use high-performance, high-precision math libraries and native PhysX support to develop 
        realistic interactions and behaviors. Create rich, believable worlds with our terrain tools. Make awesome stuff!</p>

      <h2>Fully modular</h2>
      <p>O3DE is built for extensibility and customization. Add new shaders, new editing tools, new features&mdash;and even entirely new 
        development workflows to your O3DE-based project! Use established languages and tools like C++, CMake, and Qt to build atop O3DE with well-defined templates, styles,
        and interfaces. Develop new graphics models for the Atom renderer with the flexible shader and material systems. Use specialized components, 
        called "Gems", to add in the functionality you need&mdash;including both O3DE-developed features and 3rd party ones.

        <h2>Integrate with your favorite tools and services</h2>
        <p>Need a specific feature or support for a specific cloud service? There might be a Gem for it! Or contribute your own Gems and share your tools and libraries
          with the rest of the O3DE community. Think of O3DE as an "SDK" where your project includes just the tools, libraries, and services you need!</p>
