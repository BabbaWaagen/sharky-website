### One theme. One open source 3D engine. Eighty hours. Limitless possibility.

Join us May 5-7, 2023, for the first ever O3DE Jam! With a theme of “Navigating the Wasteland,” this virtual hackathon-style competition will provide a showcase for open source developers around the world and unleash the power of Open 3D Engine (O3DE).

So, put on your creativity cap, download the [latest version](https://www.o3de.org/download/) of O3DE, and prepare to show us things we might find in a postapocalyptic future – and how those things interact with their wasteland surroundings.

Whether you work solo or as a team, you’ll have a chance to share your creation and code with the world, interact with other submissions, and rate them. Everyone gains experience and exposure, and winning entries receive a free [IDGA](https://igda.org/) membership.

Submissions can be 3D graphics, games, simulations, or anything else built with O3DE and aligned with the theme. Get creative and show us what you’ve got!

You can find all the details and register for the jam [here](https://itch.io/jam/o3de-jam). In the meantime, join us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/o3de).

We can’t wait to see what you create with O3DE!
