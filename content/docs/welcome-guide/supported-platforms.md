**Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** supports several _host platforms_ for creating and developing games and simulations, and _target platforms_ on which these projects can run.

### Host platforms

| Host Platform | Platform-specific Documentation |
| --- | --- |
| Microsoft Windows | <ul><li>[Windows prerequisites and configuration](requirements/#microsoft-windows)</li><li>[Installing O3DE for Windows](setup/installing-windows)</li><li>[Creating projects from the CLI on Windows](create/creating-projects-using-cli/creating-windows/)<sup>1</sup></li><li>[Building O3DE from source on Windows](setup/setup-from-github/building-windows/)</li></ul> |
| Linux | <ul><li>[Linux prerequisites and configuration](requirements/#linux)</li><li>[Installing O3DE for Linux](setup/installing-linux)</li><li>[Creating projects from the CLI on Linux](create/creating-projects-using-cli/creating-linux/)<sup>1</sup></li><li>[Building O3DE from source on Linux](setup/setup-from-github/building-linux/)</li></ul> |
| macOS | Support for developing on macOS is in an experimental stage. Documentation coming in 2022. |

<sup>1</sup> Platform-independent documentation on creating projects using **Project Manager** can be found [here](create/creating-projects-using-project-manager).

For minimum hardware requirements for development on host platforms, refer to [System Requirements](requirements).
