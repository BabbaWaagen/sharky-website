{{< preview-new >}}

This tutorial provides an introduction to project configuration in Open 3D Engine (O3DE). The instructions here will guide you through the following steps:

* Creating a new O3DE project.
* Creating a Visual Studio project in the O3DE project directory.
* Building the O3DE **Editor** and **AssetProcessor** in the O3DE project directory.

At the end of the tutorial you'll have a new O3DE project based on the default project template.

## Prerequisites

The instructions that follow assume you have the following:

* O3DE installed on your computer. For help, see [Setup](/docs/welcome-guide/setup).
* An O3DE engine registered in the O3DE manifest. When setting up O3DE from GitHub, you must manually register the engine. For help, see [Register O3DE engine](/docs/welcome-guide/setup/setup-from-github/#register-o3de-engine).
* Met all hardware and software requirements listed in [System Requirements](/docs/welcome-guide/setup/requirements.md).

## Create a new O3DE project

Project directories can be located either in the same directory as the O3DE root directory or outside of this directory. The latter are referred to as "external projects" in this documentation.

{{< caution >}}
External projects are considered experimental. They might be unstable in some scenarios.

**To create a new O3DE project from command line**

1. Open a command line in your O3DE engine directory.

    ```cmd
    cd <path to o3de>
    ```

1. Use the `o3de` script to create a new project. The `create-project` command, used with the `project-path` and no other options, creates a new project using the default project template.

    ```cmd
    scripts\o3de create-project --project-path <full path to project>
    ```

1. Register the project. This adds your new project to the list of known projects in the O3DE manifest, located at `<user directory>/.o3de/o3de_manifest.json`.

    ```cmd
    scripts\o3de register -p <full path to project>
    ```

1. Use CMake to create the Visual Studio project from within the new project directory. Supply the project path, the build path, the Visual Studio generator, the path to the third-party packages, and any other project options. Paths can be absolute or relative.

    ```cmd
    cd <path to project>
    cmake -B build -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" ^
        -DLY_3RDPARTY_PATH=<path to 3rd party packages> ^
        -DLY_UNITY_BUILD=ON
    ```

    {{< note >}}
Unity builds are recommended for improved build performance. If you encounter a build error, disable unity builds to help with debugging the problem.

1. Use CMake to build the O3DE **Editor** and **AssetProcessor**. Building the `profile` configuration is shown here. When specifying the Editor as a build target, the AssetProcessor will be built too, since it is a dependency of the Editor.

    ```cmd
    cmake --build <path to project>/build --target Editor --config profile -- /m
    ```

    {{< note >}}
The `/m` is a recommended build tool optimization, which tells MSVC to use multiple threads during compilation to speed up build times.

1. When the build completes, the binaries are available in the project build path. Run the Editor from the command line to verify a successful build. Be sure to supply a project path. The path can be absolute or relative. If relative, it must be relative to the _engine_ directory.

    ```cmd
    build\bin\profile\Editor.exe --project-path <path to project>
    ```
