After installing Open 3D Engine (O3DE), you're ready to create your first O3DE project. Projects define and configure the set of code and assets that make up your game or other application. Projects need a project directory, which you can create anywhere that's convenient to youâ€”within the O3DE directory itself, somewhere else on your computer, or even on a network drive.

## Creating a project

You create O3DE projects using the `o3de` tool and the CMake scripts included with O3DE. To get started with a common set of features, it's typically easiest to create your project using the O3DE default project template. This template specifies a set of Gems that enable these common features.

You can create a project using either the GUI-based O3DE **Project Manager** tool or the command line interface (CLI). The topics in this section introduce you to creating O3DE projects using either of these options.
