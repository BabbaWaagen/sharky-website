Now that you've [installed Open 3D Engine (O3DE)](../setup), you're ready to create your first O3DE project. Projects define and configure the set of code and assets that make up your game or other application. Projects need a project directory, which you can create anywhere that's convenient to youâ€”within the O3DE directory itself, somewhere else on your computer, or even on a network drive.

You can create a project using either the GUI-based **Project Manager** tool or the command line interface (CLI). The topics in this section introduce you to creating O3DE projects using either of these options.
