To get started quickly with O3DE, download and run the installer. The following instructions guide you through the installation process. After a successful install, you'll have a stable, pre-built version of the engine and its Gems, and you'll be ready to create new or open existing projects with the **Project Manager** tool.

## Prerequisites

The instructions here assume that you have:

* Met all hardware and software requirements listed in [O3DE System Requirements](./requirements).
* Configured the required software as described in the [Software configuration](./requirements#software-configuration) section of the system requirements topic.

## Installing O3DE

1. Get the latest version of the installer from the [O3DE download](https://o3de.org/download/) page.

1. Run the installer from your download location.

1. During the developer preview, you might encounter the following warning from Microsoft Defender describing the program as an unrecognized app. To proceed with installation, choose **More info**, and then choose **Run anyway**.

1. During installation, the installer downloads additional packages as needed. The process can take some time, depending on your internet connection speed. Note that additional windows might open and close during installationâ€”for example, when installing the Python runtime in the engine's `python` directory.

    The installer creates two shortcuts on the desktop for common O3DE applications:

    Editor is a central hub for O3DE's creative tools. To help you implement your project goals, use Editor to place and group entities, add components, configure properties, and open supporting tools such as **Animation Editor** and **Script Canvas**. To learn more about Editor, take the [Editor tour](/docs/welcome-guide/get-started/editor-tour).

    Create and customize projects using the Project Manager tool. To add or remove functionality for your project, you can also enable or disable Gems.

    For an introduction to Project Manager and help creating your first project, continue to [Creating Projects Using the Open 3D Engine Project Manager](/docs/welcome-guide/get-started/project-config/creating-projects-using-project-manager) to take an introductory tutorial.
