**Motions** contain keyframe animated sequences that can be sequenced and blended in **Animation Editor** and applied to actors to create behaviors\. Motions must use identical skeleton hierarchies as their actor counterparts\. 

## Export a motion<a name="fbx-exporting-motions"></a>

1. Copy your `.fbx` file to a sub directory in your project located at `lumberyard_version\dev\your_project`\. 

   Alternatively, choose **Import** from the **File** menu in Lumberyard Editor to copy or move the `.fbx` file into your project\. 

1. Locate the `.fbx` in **Asset Browser**\. 

1. Right click the `.fbx` in **Asset Browser** and choose **Edit Settings** to open **FBX Settings**\. 

1. In **FBX Settings**, in the **Motions** tab, ensure the desired root bone of the actor's skeleton is selected in the **Select root bone** property\. 

   A **Motion** may contain only one skeleton hierarchy, and will only export bones that are part of the selected heirarchy\. 

   A **Motion** exports a single animation sequence\. If the `.fbx` contains multiple animation sequences, additional motions can be added by choosing **Add another motion**\. 

1. Set the properties for each motion\. Add modifiers to each motion as required\. For information on **Motion** properties and modifiers, see [FBX Settings Motions tab](fbx-settings-motions-tab.md)\. 

1. Choose the **Update** button at the bottom right of the **FBX Settings** window\. A **File progress** window opens to display information about asset processing\. Choose **OK** to close the **File progress** window\. This step creates or updates the `.assetinfo` file\. **Asset Processor** automatically processes the `.fbx` file and generates the runtime `.motion` files\. 

1. Close the **FBX Settings** window\. 
**Note**  
When you close **FBX Settings** after making changes, you might see a pop\-up window warning of unsaved changes\. This is a known issue and can be disregarded\.
