# Reference for Android<a name="android-reference"></a>

 This section is a reference for commands and build settings used by Lumberyard when working with the Android platform\. For general information and system\-wide build settings or commands, see the following topics\. 
+ [Waf Commands and Options](waf-commands.md)
+ [Waf Project Settings](waf-project-settings.md)

**Topics**
+ [Build command reference](#android-reference-build)
+ [Waf settings](#android-waf-settings)
+ [Android build configuration file](#android-specific-settings)
+ [Other command\-line arguments](#android-command-line-args)

## Build command reference<a name="android-reference-build"></a>

 This section contains information on the available build variants and commands that are used to build and deploy Android projects through `lmbr_waf`\. The `lmbr_waf` commands are structured as `command_android_armv8_clang_variant`\. For example, you deploy a debug build to a device with the following command: 

```
lmbr_waf deploy_android_armv8_clang_debug -p game_and_engine
```

**Tip**  
 Since you never need to build the editor or any tools for Android, you can always use the `game_and_engine` project spec with any Android commands\. 

 Valid values for all of these parts of a command are indexed here\. You can also display all available Android build commands by using `lmbr_waf --help` from the command line\. 

### Commands<a name="android-waf-commands"></a>

**build**  
Build the currently selected Lumberyard project\.

**deploy**  
Manually deploy to a connected device\.

**clean**  
Clean local build artifacts\. This command doesn't perform any device cleanup\.

**package**  
Package the contents of your project into a single distributable APK\.

### Build variants<a name="android-waf-variants"></a>

**debug**  
Enables debugging\. Does not change or disable any optimizations during compile time\.

**profile**  
Enables debugging\. Does not change or disable any optimizations during compile time\.

**release**  
Disables debugging and strips debug symbols in the final build\.

## Waf settings<a name="android-waf-settings"></a>

 The Waf build system settings can be controlled by either setting an attribute value in `lumberyard_install_dir/dev/_WAF_/user_settings.options`, or by passing an argument on the command line\. The configuration file is written in [INI file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file)\. Each of the following reference tables are named after their corresponding INI section header\. 

 For a full reference of all configurable Waf settings, see [Waf User Options and Settings](waf-user-options-and-settings.md)\.

## Android build configuration file<a name="android-specific-settings"></a>

 Lumberyard stores some settings for the Android platform in an independent file, `lumberyard_install_dir\dev\_WAF_\android\android_settings.json`\. This file contains a JSON dictionary of build setting names and their values\. 

**Important**  
 After making any changes to the Android settings, run `lmbr_waf configure`\. Taking this action causes your changes to be imported to the generated Android Studio project and its manifest information\. 

**DEV\_KEYSTORE\_ALIAS**  
 The keystore alias used in the **Development** environment by the Android JAR signer\. This value is exported to the build command's environment as `KEYSTORE_ALIAS`\. 

**DEV\_KEYSTORE**  
 The path to the keystore used in the **Development** environment by the Android JAR signer\. This path should either be absolute or relative to the `lumberyard_install_dir\dev` directory\. This value is exported to the build command's environment as `KEYSTORE`\. 

**DISTRO\_KEYSTORE\_ALIAS**  
 The keystore alias used in the **Distribution** environment by the Android JAR signer\. This value is exported to the build command's environment as `KEYSTORE_ALIAS`\. 

**DISTRO\_KEYSTORE**  
 The path to the keystore used in the **Distribution** environment by the Android JAR signer\. This path should either be absolute or relative to the `lumberyard_install_dir\dev` directory\. This value is exported to the build command's environment as `KEYSTORE`\. 

**BUILD\_TOOLS\_VER**  
 The version of the Android build tools to use\. The value can either be **latest** to use the most recent version of the Android build tools, or a specific version identifier\. 

**SDK\_VERSION**  
 The SDK version to use\. The value must be in the format **android\-*apilevel***, where *apilevel* is the API level of the SDK\. 

**NDK\_PLATFORM**  
 The NDK version to use\. The value must be in the format **android\-*version***, where *version* is the major version number of the NDK\. 

**BUILD\_ENVIRONMENT**  
Selects which environment is being built for\. Valid values are **Development** and **Distribution** \(case\-sensitive\)\.    
**Development**  
The default environment, used for daily development\. Building for the Development environment doesn't require a key store or signing key\.  
**Distribution**  
 Build for distribution to the Google Play Store\. This environment requires that you use the `--distro-key-pass` and `--distro-store-pass` arguments to access the distribution key store and your signing key\. 

## Other command\-line arguments<a name="android-command-line-args"></a>

 Android builds use some command\-line arguments that are not stored in a configuration file because they would contain sensitive data, or are best for one\-off use\. There are also some arguments that override some settings that are less commonly changed\. 

`--android-sdk-version-override`  
Override the Android SDK version used in the Java compilation\. Only works during configure\.

`--android-ndk-platform-override`  
Override the Android NDK platform version used in the native compilation\. Only works during configure\.

`--dev-store-pass`  
 The password for the development keystore\. Lumberyard ships with a store with the password `Lumberyard` by default\. This default password is used in the Development environment if this command\-line argument is missing\. 

`--dev-key-pass`  
 The password for the development key\. Lumberyard ships with a self\-signed key with the password `Lumberyard` in its default key store\. This default password is used in the Development environment if this command\-line argument is missing\. 

`--distro-store-pass`  
The password for the distribution keystore\. This argument is required when using the Distribution environment\.

`--distro-key-pass`  
The password for the distribution key\. This argument is required when using the Distribution environment\.

`--deploy-android-attempt-libs-only`  
 Push only the changed native libraries\. If `deploy_android_executable` is enabled, it takes precedence if the executable was modified\. This option is ignored if `deploy_android_clean_device` is enabled\. This argument only works when deploying to a rooted device\. 

## Lumberyard project settings for Android<a name="android-reference-project-settings"></a>

 As part of every Lumberyard project, there is a settings file that describes the application and per\-project build settings\. This file is located at `lumberyard_install_dir/dev/project-name/project.json`\. Within the JSON dictionary contained in this file is the key `android_settings`, with a value of a JSON dictionary that contains the settings used by your project when building and deploying for Android\.
