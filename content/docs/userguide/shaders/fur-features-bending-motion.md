# Motion Bending {#shader-ref-fur-features-bending-motion}

Motion bending occurs when a furry entity's transform changes, such as its position, rotation, or scale\. The fur appears to lag behind the motion slightly, and catches up over a short time\. You can tune this globally using the [console variable](/docs/userguide/shaders/fur-consolevariables.md) `r_FurMovementBendingBias`\.
