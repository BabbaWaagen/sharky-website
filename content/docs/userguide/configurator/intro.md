The Project Configurator is a standalone application that allows you to specify to the Waf build system which game projects and assets \([Gems](/docs/userguide/gems/builtin/s.md)\) to include in a game build\. With it, you can create new projects, save active projects, configure advanced settings, and enable, disable, or create new [Gems](/docs/userguide/gems/builtin/s.md)\. You can also use [Lmbr\.exe](lmbr-exe.md) to perform these functions in a command line environment\.

For information about Waf build system, see [Using the Waf Build System](/docs/userguide/waf/intro.md)\. For information about Gems, see [Add modular features and assets with Gems](/docs/userguide/gems/builtin/s.md)\.

**Note**  
Before you can run the Project Configurator, you must first run [Lumberyard Setup Assistant](lumberyard-launcher-using.md) and close Lumberyard Editor\.
