# Engaging Broadcasters and Viewers on Twitch<a name="twitch-intro"></a>

Lumberyard is integrated with Twitch so that you can build games that engage with broadcasters and viewers on Twitch\.

**Twitch ChatPlay**  
The Twitch ChatPlay feature within Lumberyard helps you build gameplay that interacts in real time with Twitch viewers\. For example, you can build a game where viewers can vote on game outcomes, gift power\-ups to their favorite players, or change the level based on the number of viewers watching the player\.

**Twitch JoinIn**  
The Twitch JoinIn feature within Lumberyard helps you build multiplayer games that allow Twitch broadcasters to invite fans to join them side by side in the game\. Once invited, a fan can jump into the broadcaster's game with a single click in the Twitch chat channel, while others continue to watch\.

**Twitch API**  
 Lumberyard interacts with the Twitch system by making calls through to the Twitch API directly\. If you need any specific information about working with Twitch or the requirements of making certain API calls, see the [Twitch API documentation](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/)\. 

**Twitch C\+\+ API**  
The Twitch C\+\+ API operations allow you to make calls on the TwitchRequestBus and return a unique ReceiptID object\.
