# Using Lumberyard sample projects and levels {#sample-projects-levels-intro}

Lumberyard provides a variety of sample projects, levels, and assets, which are located in the `\lumberyard_version\dev` directory\. 

Use the Project Configurator to set or change your default project\. For more information, see [Creating Lumberyard projects](/docs/userguide/configurator/intro.md)\.

**Samples Project**  
The Samples Project includes many sample levels that demonstrate various Lumberyard features, such as the [Fur Shader](/docs/userguide/shaders/fur.md), [Rin Locomotion](/docs/userguide/animation/editor/rin-locomotion-sample.md), [UI samples](/docs/userguide/ui/editor/components.md), and more\. For a complete list and descriptions of levels, see [Samples Project](/docs/userguide/samples/projects/samples.md)\.
