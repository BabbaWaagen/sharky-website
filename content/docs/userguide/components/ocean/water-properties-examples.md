# Understanding Water Properties {#infinite-ocean-component-water-properties-examples}

When working with water properties, the color and appearance come from two places: 
+ Reflections that occur on the surface\.
+ How light interacts with water molecules and suspended particles in the water\. In Lumberyard this is called *underwater fog*\.

The following images demonstrate how bright highlights come from the sky reflection, mostly at sharp angles or in bright reflection points\. Notice how the underwater fog appears differently, as particles such as algae, dust, and plankton can change the appearance of the water\.

**Example**  
In the following example, the underwater fog appears greenish\.

**Example**  
In the following example, the underwater fog appears brown\.

Avoid using only the reflection to achieve the appearance that you want\. The water appearance is the sum of the reflection on the ocean surface and the underwater fog below the surface\.
