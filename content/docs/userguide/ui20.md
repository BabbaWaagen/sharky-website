# Lumberyard UI 2\.0 Developer Documentation<a name="ui20"></a>

Introduced with Amazon Lumberyard version 1\.25, UI 2\.0 is the user interface framework used by Lumberyard's editors and tools\. It uses the C\+\+ Qt UI library and can be extended to support your own customizations and modifications\.

## What is Lumberyard UI 2\.0?<a name="what-is-ui20"></a>

UI 2\.0 is designed to enable easy\-to\-use workflows and help your game designers and developers translate their ideas into quick simulations\. When developing the new LumberyardUI, we focused on these four tenets: 
+ Efficiency
+ Accessibility
+ Familiarity
+ Modularity

To achieve this, we provided a complete set of Qt\-based user interface building blocks so that you can create tools to fit your own needs, while still employing a coherent and standardized UI experience throughout the Lumberyard Editor\.

When creating tools, developers have access to the controls that we're now using throughout Lumberyard, which includes the following elements:
+ Breadcrumbs
+ Browse edit *\(input field with button\)*
+ Button
+ Card
+ Check box / toggle switch
+ Color picker and color label 
+ Combo box
+ Filtered search widget
+ Gradient slider
+ Hyperlinks
+ Line edit
+ Menu
+ Progress indicators
+ Radio buttons
+ Reflected property editor
+ Scrollbar
+ Segment control
+ Slider
+ Sliders with combo box
+ Spin\-box *\(Line edit with drag support\)*
+ Vector input spin\-box
+ Splitter
+ Styled dock widget
+ Tabs
+ Table view
+ Toolbar
+ Tree view
+ Typography

## UI 2\.0 overview<a name="ui20-overview"></a>

 With Lumberyard 1\.25 and later versions, developers can use Lumberyardâ€™s custom Qt widget library to create their own developer tools and modify existing tools to blend into the user experience of the rest of the Lumberyard Editor\. We have provided a set of styles and user interaction patterns that are applied on top of the Qt framework, which is the C\+\+ based library Lumberyard relies on for its UI\. For more information about how UI 2\.0 works and UI component development, see the [Amazon Lumberyard UI Extensions Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/ui/)

## Review the UI 2\.0 components<a name="ui20-components"></a>

Before you begin, make sure that you have Lumberyard 1\.25 or later installed on your machine\.

**To review the UI components**

1. Open File Explorer and go to your build directory\. \(For example, **C:\\\{your\-lumberyard\-installation\-path\}\\\{version\}\\dev\\Bin64vc141\\** or **Bin64vc142\\**\.\)

1. Double\-click on **AmazonQtControlGallery\.exe** to open the `UI 2.0 Qt Control Gallery` app\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/ui/ui20-qt-control-gallery-main.jpg)

1. Use the main dropdown menu to navigate through the pages\. For each component, the right column shows a live example of how the widget will look and work inside the Lumberyard Editor or for your tool\. The left column displays the code used to produce that result\.
**Note**  
The Gallery does not cover how to set up a window for your tool, or the basics of how the Qt library works\. Its primary objective is to illustrate the attributes of the Lumberyard Component Gallery\.
