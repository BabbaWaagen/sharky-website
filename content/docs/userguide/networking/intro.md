# Using Lumberyard Networking<a name="network-intro"></a>

Lumberyard's GridMate networking system is designed for efficient bandwidth usage and low\-latency communications\. You can synchronize objects over the network with GridMate's replica framework\. GridMate's session management integrates with major online console services and lets you handle peer\-to\-peer and client\-server topologies with host migration\. GridMate also supports in\-game achievements, leaderboards, and cloud\-based saved games through third\-party social services such as Steam\. For an example of how to set up a multiplayer project, see [Multiplayer Sample](/docs/userguide/samples/projects/multiplayer-enhanced.md)\.

This section discusses the various components of, and setup requirements for, your Amazon Lumberyard game networking environment\. For information about a diagnostic tool for networking, see [Profiler](/docs/userguide/debugging/profiling/intro.md)\.
