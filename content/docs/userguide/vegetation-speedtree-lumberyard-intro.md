# Using SpeedTree 8 for Lumberyard<a name="vegetation-speedtree-lumberyard-intro"></a>

SpeedTree 8 for Lumberyard is a procedural vegetation modeling program that takes advantage of the native Lumberyard vegetation tools\. You can use SpeedTree 8 for Lumberyard to create and quickly iterate on trees, bushes, exotic alien foliage species, and other plant life\.

The SpeedTree integration provides a simple workflow to add level of detail \(LOD\) and preview wind accurately with Lumberyard's wind physics integrated directly into the app\.

The SpeedTree modeler exports Lumberyard meshes and materials into your game project\. You can then use these meshes and materials the same way you would use any other mesh or vegetation object\.
