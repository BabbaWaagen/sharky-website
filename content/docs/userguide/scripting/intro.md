# Scripting in Amazon Lumberyard<a name="scripting-intro"></a>

Lumberyard includes two scripting technologies for automating gameplay: Script Canvas and Lua\.

**Script Canvas**  
A visual scripting environment that you can use to create game logic and behaviors without writing code\. In the **Script Canvas** editor, you create, connect, and rearrange graphical nodes that provide a visual representation of the logic flow\.  
For more information, see [Creating Gameplay with Script Canvas](/docs/userguide/scripting/scriptcanvas/intro.md)\.

**Lua**  
A powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language\. Lua facilitates quick iteration in your game project because you can run your changes immediately without needing to recompile your source code\.  
For more information, see [Writing Lua Scripts](/docs/userguide/scripting/lua/intro.md)\.

Lumberyard's functionality is exposed to Script Canvas and Lua by the behavior context\. For more information, see [Behavior Context](/docs/userguide/components/entity-system-reflection-behavior-context.md)\.
