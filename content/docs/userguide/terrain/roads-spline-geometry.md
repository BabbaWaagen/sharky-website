1. Under **Spline Parameters**, click **Edit**, and do any of the following for the road in your level:
   + To move a point, drag it\.
   + To add a new point, hold down **Ctrl** while you click on the spline at the desired location\.
   + To delete a point, double\-click it\.
   + To change the angle at a point, select it and adjust the **Angle** value\.
   + To change the width at a point, select it, clear the **Default width** check box, and adjust the **Width** value\.
