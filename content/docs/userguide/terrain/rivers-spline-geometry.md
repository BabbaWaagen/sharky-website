You can make precise changes to the geometry of a river\. You simply adjust the spline points and parameters\.

**To adjust river spline parameters**

1. In the **Rollup Bar**, on the **Objects** tab, click **Misc**, **River**\.

1. Under **Spline Parameters**, click **Edit**, and do any of the following for the river in your level:
   + To move a point, drag it\.
   + To add a new point, hold down **Ctrl** while clicking the spline at the desired location\.
   + To delete a point, double\-click it\.
   + To change the angle at a point, select it and adjust the **Angle** value\.
   + To change the width at a point, select it, clear the **Default width** check box, and adjust the **Width** value\.

**Tip**
You can also change the positions of any spline point\. Just select a point and use the **X, Y, Z**, and **XY** axis\-lock buttons located at the top of Lumberyard Editor\.
