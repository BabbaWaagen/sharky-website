The Flatten brush makes any piece of terrain completely flat at a height that you define\. This is useful for creating a variety of features such as plateaus, mesas, and buttes as well as creating flat spots wherever needed\.

**To use the Flatten brush**

1. In the **Rollup Bar**, on the **Terrain** tab, click **Modify**, **Flatten**\.

1. In the level, drag the mouse to create a flat spot\. The terrain is flattened at the selected **Height** and **Diameter** brush settings\.

1. Under **Modify Terrain**, adjust **Brush Settings** and **Noise Settings** parameters as needed\. See [Terrain Brush Parameters](/docs/userguide/terrain/landforms-brush-params.md) for more information\.
