# Implementing New Fonts<a name="ui-fonts"></a>

You can add fonts to your game UI in Lumberyard by saving the font asset to your game project and creating an `.xml` file that contains specifics for that font, such as the path to the font file and parameters that affect the font's appearance\. You can combine multiple font assets into a single font family and further customize text appearance using [Text Markup](ui-editor-components-text.md#ui-editor-component-text-styling-markup)\.

Using the procedures in this section, you can:
