# Animating the UI {#ui-animating}

You can animate your game's UI using one of the following tools:

[**Scripted Entity Tweener System**](/docs/userguide/ui/animating/tweener.md)
Installed as a gem, this system uses custom Lua scripts to create powerful and flexible animations\.

[**UI Animation Editor**](/docs/userguide/ui/animation/_index.md)
Embedded as a GUI in the **UI Editor**, this tool can create complex animations\. You activate your animation sequences by using Script Canvas, with the UiAnimationBus eBus, or through C\+\+ scripting\.
