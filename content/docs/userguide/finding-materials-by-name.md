# Finding the Material Name {#finding-materials-by-name}

You can specify material names to reference for nodes in the **Script Canvas** editor\. The material name is generally the path that starts at the top asset directory but without the `.mtl` file name extension\.

**To find the material name**

1. In Lumberyard Editor, choose **Tools**, **Material Editor**\.

1. In the **Material Editor**, navigate to the material file\.

1. Right\-click the material file and choose **Copy Path to Clipboard**\. This copies the path to the file\.
**Example**

   In the Samples Project, the material name for `logo_white.mtl` is `materials/gettingstartedmaterials/logo_white`\.
