# Placing Distance Clouds {#weather-clouds-2d-distance-mesh}

Distance clouds are two\-dimensional clouds that are placed at a great distance, such as on the horizon or at high altitudes\. Distance clouds are suitable for creating a realistic distant sky scene without causing rendering performance issues\. Distance clouds do not move and cannot be flown through\.
