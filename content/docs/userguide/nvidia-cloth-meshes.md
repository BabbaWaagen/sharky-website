# Cloth for Mesh components<a name="nvidia-cloth-meshes"></a>

| This feature is in [preview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/ly-glos-chap.html#preview) release and is subject to change\.  | 

To use **Cloth**, you must enable the **NVIDIA Cloth** gem\. For more information, see the [NVIDIA Cloth gem](nvidia-cloth.md) documentation\. 

You can create cloth assets for entities with **Mesh** components in the content creation application of your choice and import them into Lumberyard from an `.fbx` file\. The mesh asset should have the following: 
+ A cloth mesh that will be simulated and rendered in Lumberyard\. 
  + Cloth data can be added to define per vertex mass and constraint properties using the vertex color tool in your content creation application\. For more information see [Per vertex properties for cloth](nvidia-cloth-vertex-data.md)\. 
+ **Optional** \- Any other static mesh\. For example, if you create a flag to be simulated as cloth, then you can include a mesh for the flag pole\. 

**Note**  
Sample **Mesh** component cloth assets are located in the **NVIDIA Cloth** gem directory, which is located at `/dev/Gems/NvCloth/Assets/Objects/cloth/Environment/`\. 

For imformation on exporting mesh assets, see [FBX Settings mesh export](fbx-mesh-export.md)

## Add Cloth to Mesh components<a name="cloth-mesh-setup"></a>

Create cloth by adding the **Cloth** component to an entity that has a **Mesh** component, and then setting the properties of the **Cloth** component\. 

1. In Lumberyard Editor, add a new entity to the level\. 

1. Add a **Mesh** component to the entity, and reference the mesh asset and material\. 

1. Add a **Cloth** component to the entity\. 

1. Set the cloth data of the mesh asset\.

   1. Click the button beside the **Mesh node** property to open the **FBX Settings** window\.

   1. In the **FBX Settings** window, on the **Meshes** tab, and choose **Add Modifier**, **Cloth**\. 

   1. In the **Cloth** modifier area: 

      1. Select the cloth mesh from the drop\-down list\. 

      1. When applicable, select the vertex color stream and channel that includes the **Inverse Masses** data\. If data is not provided, then cloth defaults to an inverse mass value of 1\.0 for all vertices\. 

      1. When applicable, select the vertex color stream and channel that include the **Motion Constraints** data\. If data is not provided, then cloth defaults to a motion constraint value of 1\.0 for all vertices\. 

      1. When applicable, select the vertex color streams and channels that includes the **Backstop Offset** and **Backstop Radius** data\. If data is not provided, then no backstop constraints will be applied in the simulation\.

   1. Choose the **Update** button\. **Asset Processor** then updates the asset and includes the cloth data\. 

1. Configure the cloth component\. 

   1. Select the cloth mesh node from the drop\-down list\.

   1. Adjust cloth properties to obtain the desired cloth behavior\. For more information, see [Cloth Component](component-cloth.md)\.
