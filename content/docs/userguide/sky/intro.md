You can create realistic\-looking skies by setting sun, moon, atmospheric, and time\-of\-day effects\. You can create two types of skies: dynamic and static\.

Dynamic skies use the [SkyHDR Shader](/docs/userguide/shaders/skyhdr.md) to render realistic effects\.

The primary tools used to create different sky effects for your level are the Time of Day Editor and the Sun Trajectory Tool, as shown below:
