# Setting Daytime Atmospheric Effects {#sky-day-atmosphere}

To create dynamic daytime sky atmospheric effects, you modify sun and light\-scattering setting that affect the appearance of distant objects, which shift in color due to atmospheric interference\. These settings do not directly affect the rendering of objects or environment lighting colors and intensities\.

**To set daytime atmospheric effects**

1. In Lumberyard Editor, choose **Tools**, **Other**, **Time Of Day**\.

1. In the **Parameters** pane, for **Sky Light**, adjust the [Sky Light Parameters](/docs/userguide/sky/tod-parameters#sky-light-time-of-day-parameters) as needed\.

1. Close the **Time of Day** editor\.
