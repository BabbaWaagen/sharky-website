# Fog Systems {#rendering-graphics-fog-intro}

Lumberyard supports a standard fog system as well as a voxel\-based volumetric fog system\. Which one to use for your game comes down to balancing performance over visual quality\. Volumetric fog looks superior but comes at a performance cost\. The standard fog system is very cheap performance\-wise to compute\.

You can also add realistic\-looking fog above water surfaces, as well as add volumetric fog shadows\.
