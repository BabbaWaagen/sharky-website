# Adding lighting and shadows {#rendering-graphics-lighting-intro}

Lumberyard uses physically\-based lighting and shading models to implement global illumination and lighting\.

For information about the Light entity and the Environment Probe entity used in environment lighting, see [Light Entities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/legacyreference/entities-entity-light.html)\.

For information about using the Time of Day Editor to simulate the changing lighting effects caused by the sun moving across the sky, see [Creating Time of Day Sky Effects](/docs/userguide/sky/tod-intro.md)\.
