# UiBasics Gem {#gems-system-gem-uibasics}

The UiBasics Gem is a collection of assets to be used as defaults with the Lumberyard UI Editor, including basic UI prefabs \(image, text, button, and text input\) and the textures that those prefabs require\. For more information, see [Creating and Customizing Project User Interfaces](/docs/userguide/ui/editor/intro.md)\.
