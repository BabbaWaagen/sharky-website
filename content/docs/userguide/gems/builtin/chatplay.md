|  The ChatPlay Gem is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Lumberyard\. It has been replaced by the [Twitch Chat API Gem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/gem-twitch-chatplay.html)\.  | 

The Twitch ChatPlay Gem provides a flexible framework to create customized game interactions between broadcasters and spectators on Twitch, the world's leading social video platform and community for gamers\. Twitch ChatPlay includes support for chat commands, polls, and surveys that can be triggered by Twitch viewers through the Twitch chat channel\.

For example, you can create a chat command `#cheer` that triggers celebration animations in your game\.
