|  The Input Management Framework Gem is in [preview](/docs/userguide/ly-glos-chap#preview) release and is subject to change\.  |

The Input Management Framework gem provides a framework for managing cross\-platform game input such as keyboard, controller, and touch in Lumberyard with the component entity system\.

![\[Enable the Input Management Framework gem for the Input component.\]](/images/userguide/gems/input-management-framework-gem.png)

The gem works with the [Starting Point Input](/docs/userguide/gems/starting-point-input.md) gem, which supplies the processed raw input\. The Input Management Framework gem then takes that input and converts it to user\-defined gameplay events with the **[Input](/docs/userguide/components/input.md)** component\.

For an example, see [Working with the Input Component](/docs/userguide/working-with-the-input-component.md)\.

For more information, see [Input in Amazon Lumberyard](/docs/userguide/input-intro.md)\.
