The Physics Entities Gem is a collection of physics entities used to simulate physical events such as explosions, gravity fields, or wind, or to physicalize objects such as cloth, breakable entities, or ropes\. Physical entities that are related to a body instead of an event are connected to an object\.

**To access the Physics entities**

1. In the **Rollup Bar**, on the **Objects** tab, choose **Entity**\.

1. Expand **Physics**\.

1. Drag the entity into your level in the viewport\.
