# Sky Clouds Gem {#gems-system-gem-cloud}

The Sky Clouds gem creates realistic and detailed cloud and weather effects in your game levels\. You can create clouds with either simple, sprite\-based shading, or more complex, voxelized 3D volume shading\.

To enable the Sky Clouds gem for your project, see [Add modular features and assets with Gems](/docs/userguide/gems/builtin/s.md)\.

For more information about creating and placing clouds in your level, see [Sky Cloud](/docs/userguide/components/sky-cloud.md)\.

For more information about working with clouds, including setting cloud shading parameters, adding 3D cloud shadows, and creating 3D cloud templates, see [Adding Clouds](/docs/userguide/weather/clouds-intro.md)\.
