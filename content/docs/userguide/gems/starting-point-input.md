# Starting Point Input Gem<a name="gems-system-starting-point-input"></a>

The Starting Point Input gem works with the [Input Management Framework](/docs/userguide/gems/builtin/input.md) gem to map low\-level input events to high\-level gameplay actions\. For example, you can specify in your game that pressing the keyboard spacebar results in a gameplay action, such as jump\.

For information about working with input events, see the **[Input](/docs/userguide/components/input.md)** component\.

For information about working with input gestures such as touch, swipe, and rotate, see the [Gestures](/docs/userguide/gems/builtin/gestures.md) gem\.
