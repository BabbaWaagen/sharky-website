_Disclaimer: As Lumberyard can only run on Windows, this tutorial can only be followed by Windows users_

## Clone the Lumberyard github repository

You can download the [Lumberyard repository](https://github.com/aws/lumberyard) or clone it onto your local machine. Cloning allows you to keep track of the changes made.

- To download, click on the green **Code** button and select **Download ZIP**. Then copy and unzip it where you want it to be.
- To clone
  1. Open a terminal or shell in the directory where you want this repository to be in. 
  2. Run the command `git clone https://github.com/aws/lumberyard.git`.

Enter the folder and click on `git_bootstrap.exe`. It will download pre-built binaries of the engine and 3rd party libraries (around 10gb to download and 25gb unzipped on disk).

Once the process is over it will open the **Lumberyard Setup Assistant**, you can close it now if you don't want to build the engine from source.

## Open the StarterGame project

Now that you have the engine binaries, you will want to select the **default project**. Simply go to `LUMBERYARD_FOLDER\dev\Bin64vc142` and run the `ProjectConfigurator.exe`. Make sure that the StarterGame project is set as default (the icon should be grayed out). If not, simply click on the icon next to the name and click on "**Set as default**" button on the top right.

In the same folder, you can run the `Editor.exe`. The asset processor will run and the editor will open after a few seconds. In the Welcome popup select *"Open level..."* and select *"Levels\Game\SinglePlayer"*.

You can play the game directly by pressing **Ctrl+G** or if you go to the top menu **Game\Play Game**.

{{< note >}}
The Lumberyard asset processor does not automatically close when you exit Lumberyard. Don't forget to close it via a right click in the notification bar if you plan to open O3DE afterwards as it will prevent the O3DE asset processor to open.

## (Optional) Build the engine from source

You will need to go through the Lumberyard Setup Assistant and follow the *"Full Install"* path. You can open this assistant anytime via `SetupAssistant.bat` in the Lumberyard folder. You will need Visual Studio 2019 with its "Desktop development with C++" component properly installed.

Once the setup is over, you might want to generate or re-generate a Visual Studio solution. Simply run `.\lmbr_waf.bat configure --enabled-game-projects=SamplesProject,StarterGame` from the **dev** folder. Then open `dev\Solutions\LumberyardSDK_vs2019.sln` with Visual Studio 2019. 

To run the editor, set **Sandbox\Editor** as startup project on right click.

## (Optional) Try out other samples

There are other project samples for Lumberyard available online and in the repository. You can use the **ProjectConfigurator** to switch between them, it will auto-detect any projects on the `dev` folder.
