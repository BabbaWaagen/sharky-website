## Open 3D Engine Documentation: Style Guide

This Style Guide for the Open 3D Engine (O3DE) documentation project provides editorial guidelines for contributors. The intent is to provide consistent voice and visuals for readers of O3DE documentation, and users of O3DE.

This guide is maintained by the O3DE Docs-SIG. For more information and to join the O3DE Docs-SIG, see LINK TO DOCS SIG.

### General Writer Guidance ###

The O3DE documentation project serves a global audience. To support English as a Second Language (ESL) readers, and to ease localization efforts, please adhere to the following guidelines.

* Use US English for accessibility.
* Whenever possible, use precise words with only one meaning, or the primary meaning of words found in [The American Heritage Dictionary](https://www.ahdictionary.com/)
* Use standard terminology. Refer to the [Dictionary](#dictionary) section of this guide for usage of common domain and industry terminology.
* Be consistent in usage of terms.
* When using acronyms, introduce them in their expanded form followed by the acronym in parentheses. For example: *Open 3D Engine (O3DE)*. 
* Use [active voice](https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/style/ccs_activevoice/).
* Keep sentences short.
* Use complete sentences.
* Consider whether information can be more clearly represented in a list or a table.
* Keep adjective and adverbs close to the words they modify.
* Avoid words ending in *-ing* when possible. Words ending in *-ing* can be verbs, adjectives, or gerunds, and can be ambiguous for ESL readers. If you must use a word ending in *-ing*,  add a determiner such as *the* before or after the word to clarify whether the word is a verb or an adjective.
* Watch for words ending in *-ed*. Words ending in *-ed* can also be ambiguous. Use determiner phrases such as *that is* to clarify the usage of words ending in *-ed*.
* Do not use idioms, slang, jargon, or colloquialisms.
* Use optional clarifying words and phrases such as *the*, *that*, *a*, *an*, *because*, *after*, *although*, and *might*.
* Use commas to make sentences easier to read and comprehend.
* Avoid Latin phrases such as *etc.* and *vs.*

### Inclusive Writing ###

The O3DE documentation project strives to be inclusive and free of bias. Be mindful of word choices and adhere to the following guidelines to create documentation that is inclusive and free of bias for a global audience.

| Don't use | Do use |
| - | - |
| blacklist | deny list |
| whitelist | allow list |
| master | leader, primary, main |
| slave, servant | follower, secondary, replica |
| abort, kill | stop, end |
| execute | start, run |

### Images and Visuals ###

In order to unify presentation and to keep the O3DE documentation repository below 1 GB, please adhere to the following guidelines when creating images for documentation:

#### General Image Guidelines ####

* Don't use aggressive compression settings.
* Image contributions should be less than 512 KB in size.
* Images containing text should use US English.
* Only use model, character, and texture assets freely available to O3DE users:
  * Assets distributed as part of O3DE.
  * Assets distributed with permissive and open source licenses such as those found at [The Stanford 3D Scanning Repository](https://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/).
  * Assets that can be quickly replicated in open source content applications such as [Blender](https://blender.org) and [Gimp](https://gimp.org).
  * If you are using assets distributed by a third party, provide a proper attribution and link for the asset in the documentation.

#### Screenshots ####

* Use `.png` format for all screenshots.
* Take screenshots at HD resolution (1920x1080).
* Use the default interface scale when taking screenshots.
* Use the default interface color theme when taking screenshots.
* Use the default interface layout whenever possible.
* Don't scale screenshots containing interface elements.
* Crop interface images to contain only the necessary elements whenever possible.

#### Animated Images ####

Animated images are not currently accepted for contribution due to limitations on repository size. If you must demonstrate steps, use a horizontal two to four panel annotated image strip demonstrating the start, action, and result of the process.

#### Image Annotations ####

To be determined.

#### Diagrams ####

* Use [draw io](https://app.diagrams.net) to create diagrams.
* Use `.svg` for diagrams.
