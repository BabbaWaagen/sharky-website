Welcome to Open 3D Engine (O3DE) docs!

O3DE documentation is driven by contributors like you. Whether you want to report an issue, document a feature, provide a tutorial, or join the [O3DE Documentation and Community Special Interest Group (SIG-Docs)](/docs/contributing/to-docs/documentation-and-community-sig), this guide will provide you the information you need. Your participation is critical. Large or small, your contributions chart the course of O3DE documentation.

### Becoming a contributor

Although there are many avenues for discussion with O3DE users and contributors, all official communication regarding O3DE docs is done through [*pull requests (PRs)*](https://github.com/o3de/o3de.org/pulls) and [*issues*](https://github.com/o3de/o3de.org/issues) in the [o3de/o3de.org GitHub repository](https://github.com/o3de/o3de.org).

O3DE welcomes feedback, suggestions, and improvements from all, no matter their level of experience. To learn how you can be an inclusive contributor, see the [O3DE Code of Conduct](/docs/contributing/code-of-conduct/).

If you want to learn about O3DE documentation oversight, see the [O3DE Documentation and Community Special Interest Group (SIG-Docs)](/docs/contributing/to-docs/documentation-and-community-sig).
