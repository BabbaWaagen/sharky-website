The O3DE documentation project is driven by contributors like you. Whether you want to report an issue, document a feature, provide a tutorial, or join the [O3DE Documentation and Community Special Interest Group (SIG-Docs)](/docs/contributing/to-docs/documentation-and-community-sig), this guide will provide you the information you need. Your participation is critical; Large or small, your contributions chart the course of O3DE documentation.

### Becoming a contributor

Although there are many avenues to communicate with O3DE users and contributors, all official communication regarding O3DE documentation is done through [*pull requests (PRs)*](https://github.com/o3de/o3de.org/pulls) and [*issues*](https://github.com/o3de/o3de.org/issues) in the [o3de/o3de.org GitHub repository](https://github.com/o3de/o3de.org).

O3DE welcomes feedback, suggestions, and improvements from all, no matter their level of experience. Please familiarize yourself with the [O3DE Code of Conduct](/docs/contributing/code-of-conduct/) to be an inclusive and effective contributor.

If you would like to help govern the O3DE documentation, please consider joining the [O3DE Documentation and Community Special Interest Group (SIG-Docs)](/docs/contributing/to-docs/documentation-and-community-sig).

### Contribution topics

Whether you are new to open source software (OSS), or have experience as a contributor with other projects, we encourage to begin with the [Get started](./get-started) section. View the project's current [issues](https://github.com/o3de/o3de.org/issues) and [PRs](https://github.com/o3de/o3de.org/pulls) before undertaking new documentation tasks. See where you might help with existing issues, log new issues, and provide feedback on existing PRs from other contributors. These steps can acquaint you with the project and other contributors, teach you the documentation process, and ensure your own contributions are successful.
