## Open 3D Engine (O3DE) Terminology

The following terms are specific to O3DE and are defined in the table below. Please use these consistently in your code and documentation.

| Term       | Variations | Explanation                                    |
|------------|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Open 3D Engine | Abbreviated: O3DE | Always capitalize the "O", the "D", and the "E". Use "Open 3D Engine (O3DE)" for the first reference in a topic, and then use the abbreviated version as you see fit.|
| Animation Editor | _\<none\>_ | Do not use "EMotionFX" or "EMFX". |
| AnimGraph | _\<none\>_ | Definition: An interactive graph of animation flows for actors in the Animation Editor, as implemented in the Open 3D Engine Editor. This is a portmanteau of "animation" and "graph. It is a proper noun as it is an implementation specific to O3DE, and the "A" and the "G" must be capitalized. |
| Gem/Gems | _\<none\>_ |  Definition: Encapsulated O3DE-specific functionality or assets, that is built and integrated into Open 3D Engine. "Gem" is a proper nouun and must be capitalized. |
| prefab/prefabs | _\<none\>_ | Definition: A collection of configured entities that is stored as a single unit in a reusable asset. Prefabs use the ".prefab" file extension. Do not capitalize this term (outside of when it starts an English language sentence) when using it. |
| spawnable/spawnables | _\<none\>_ | Definition: The run-time representation of a prefab, and contains only run-time components. Spawnables use the ".spawnable" file extension. Do not capitalize this term (outside of when it starts an English language sentence) when using it.  |
| Node/Node(s) |  _\<none\>_ | Definition: A self-contained element of a Script Canvas script. Capitalize this term when specifically referring to a Script Canvas Node or its implementation. If you are referring to the concept of nodes in general, or discussing Script Canvas Nodes at a higher level of abstraction, use the lower-case term "node"/"nodes". |
