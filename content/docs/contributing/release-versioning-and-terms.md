## Open 3D Engine (O3DE) Version Numbering

O3DE source code is versioned using the `XXXX.X` numbering format. Larger numbers indicate later versions.
O3DE binaries are versioned using the `XX.XX` numbering format. The decimal place is moved to the left by 2 values from the original source code version, and any values after 4 are truncated. Larger numbers indicate later versions.

Example:

| Source code version | Binary package version |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| 1000.0              | 10.00                  |
| 1234.5              | 12.34                  |

{{ note }}
Given that we are a new open source community, this version numbering is subject to change for future releases pending discussions and alignment between SIG-Release, the marketing committee, and the technical steering committee. We are also considering the introduction of a friendly name schema for major versions of the engine. We invite any and all feedback and contributions from the community to help define a strategy for release terminology and friendly names for future iterations of O3DE [here](https://github.com/o3de/sig-release/issues/20).
