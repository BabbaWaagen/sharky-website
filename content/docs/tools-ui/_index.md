Below you will find guidelines around using the **Open 3D Engine's (O3DE)** brand and UI style if you are looking for the O3DE logo to incorporate into your project, tools to develop the UI for your component development, or just make your life easier by checking out the custom Qt widget library for developers.

This page is constantly evolving with new updates for UI designs, patterns and assets that the contributors develop over time. This modular framework is called the **BlueJay Design System**. It contains all the components, patterns, and design elements that make up O3DE.

If you have any questions regarding the BlueJay Design System or feel like something is incorrect or missing from it, you can [file an issue](https://github.com/o3de/sig-ui-ux/issues/new/choose) with the UI/UX Special Interest Group on GitHub. We also have a public roadmap that details all our planned major updates in the years to come.  

Feel like having a chat? Check out our #SIG-UX-UI channel on Discord. The community is always happy to help!
