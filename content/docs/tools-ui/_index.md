The **BlueJay Design System** is the modular UI framework of **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)**. This guide provides information for developers on the framework and how to use it when developing components, tools, and extensions for **O3DE Editor**.

This guide includes guidelines and information on the custom Qt widget library, the Qt Control Gallery tool, and a gallery of UI icon assets for O3DE. This guide also provides O3DE brand guidelines and O3DE brand assets that you can incorporate into your own projects.

If you have any questions regarding the BlueJay Design System or have a suggestion to improve it, you can [file an issue](https://github.com/o3de/sig-ui-ux/issues/new/choose) with the UI/UX Special Interest Group on GitHub.
