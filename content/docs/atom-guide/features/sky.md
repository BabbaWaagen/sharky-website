*This page is placeholder for possible topics in the Features section.*

Everything related to sky rendering can fall under a single sky feature processor.

**Sky Feature Processor**
This is the feature processor responsible for drawing the sky. 

**HDR Skybox**
High Priority. This is the quickest and most versatile way to implement sky rendering, and should therefore be what we implement initially on Atom. An HDR skybox will help with image based lighting, another high priority item for Atom. And it doesn't put restrictions on artists since they can plug in whatever skybox they want, be it an alien planet atmosphere or real world capture data.
