**Material Canvas** drastically simplifies, accelerates, and automates creating custom shaders and material types by providing a visual scripting editor with familiar tools, workflows, status reporting, and live previews.

Drag, drop, connect, and configure nodes to construct material graphs that will automatically be transformed into standard source files for shaders, material types, and materials.  The generated source files will be recognized by the Asset Processor, processed, and usable in any systems or components that consume materials.  With the default settings, Material Canvas regenerates and overwrites files whenever a graph is opened, edited, or saved. The viewport updates to display the results as quickly as changes are made and processed.

Material Canvas is built on top of the same foundations as established tools like Script Canvas and Material Editor.  It is data-driven, customizable, extensible, and scriptable through the settings registry, Python, and C++. All of the current material graph nodes are defined in JSON files that contain snippets of AZSL. These files can be edited, and new ones created, from within Material Canvas.

This section introduces Material Canvas and describes the editor layout and its individual panels.

## Quick Start
To get started, launch Material Canvas to open or create a new material graph. 

#### Launching Material Canvas

There are multiple ways to launch Material Canvas.

- From **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** Editor select **Main Menu > Tools > Material Canvas**

- From the Material Component context menu, select **Open Material Canvas...**

- From the Asset Browser, double click on a material graph or other Material Canvas compatible file type.

- From the Asset Browser, right click on a material graph or other Material Canvas compatible file type, then select **Open in Material Canvas...** 

- Material Canvas is also a standalone executable that can be launched directly from a file browser or command console.

  - Launch the executable `<build>\bin\profile\MaterialCanvas.exe`

    - This requires passing the â€”project-path, followed by the path your project, as a command line argument.

##### Asset Processor

Material Canvas automatically launches the Asset Processor if it is not already running.  Some graphics related assets must be processed before the main window opens.

The shader compilation process is expensive, complex, and currently managed by the Shader Asset Builder.  Material Canvas relies on the Asset Processor and Shader Asset Builder to process, validate, and preview content generated by material graphs. The Asset Processor reports status, error messages, and other notifications as shader and material assets are built. The viewport updates with shader and material previews as quickly as those assets can be processed.

Building shader assets takes more time on Windows than Linux, or other platforms.  This is partially because Windows builds shaders for the null renderer, DX12, and Vulkan by default.  Registry settings can be configured to disable unused targets and vastly improve shader compilation and preview times.  Use the Material Canvas settings dialog to override these settings.

##### Gem Initialization

Material Canvas normally initializes all of the gems enabled by the active project. In order to reduce start times and system resource utilization, Material Canvas, and the other atom tools, includes registry setting files that forcibly disable several standard O3DE gems that are not likely to be needed within the tool.

If Material Canvas, or Material Editor, fails to launch then it may be because of dependency issues with gems in the active project. Check the Material Canvas, or corresponding, log file for any system entity or module initialization errors. If necessary, change or delete the custom registry settings from the Material Canvas project registry folder.

#### Editing Material Graphs
You can create a new material graph or open an existing material graph from the File menu in Material Canvas, or from the Context menu in the Asset Browser: 

- From the File menu in Material Canvas:
  
  - To create a new material graph, choose **New**, New Material Graph Document. Then select a template as the starting point for your new material graph.
  
  - To open an existing material, choose **Open...**, Open Material Graph Document. Then select the material graph file from the browser.
  
  - You may also use the **Open Recent** menu option to select a previously opened document.
  
    - Material Canvas supports editing other document types like Material Graph Node Config and Shader Source Data config files. These will also appear in the recent files list.

- From the Context menu in the Asset Browser:
  
  1. Select a `.materialgraph` file.
 
  2. Then, right-click the `.materialgraph` file to open the context menu.
  
  3. Choose **Open in Material Canvas...** to open the material in Material Canvas.

## Central Window
Material Canvas and other Atom Tools support opening and editing multiple document types, documents, and views. The main views and content for each document will be displayed as part of the central window.

### Document Tabs
The top of the central window displays tabs for each open document. The tab bar highlights the tab for the active document. You can switch between open documents by clicking on their title in the tab bar. You can close each document by clicking the X on its tab and perform other actions made available by right clicking on the tab. Tabs can be dragged and reordered but they cannot be undocked. Switching tabs will also update the inspector to display properties for the newly selected document.

### Graph View
The main document type in Material Canvas is the material graph. Each material graph document tab displays a gridded, graph view as the main workspace for viewing and editing graph nodes and connections.

## Inspector
The Inspector displays context sensitive, editable properties of the active document. For material graph documents, the inspector displays properties of each selected node in the graph view.  Changing properties in the inspector will update the graph and regenerate files.

## Node Palette
The node palette contains a tree of all available material graph nodes, and other utility nodes, that can be added to a graph. The nodes are organized by category and color coded by type. Hovering the mouse cursor over each node in the tree will display a tool tip describing its purpose. Drag nodes from the palette into the active graph view to create an instance of that node at the drop position on the graph.

## Bookmarks
Use the bookmarks panel to manage all of the bookmarks on the active graph. Place bookmarks on the graph, like pins on a map, as a point of reference for any important positions. Double clicking on a bookmark will center the graph view on that position. Bookmark descriptions and colors are configurable in the bookmarks panel and inspector.

## Mini Map
The mini map window displays a zoomed-out overview of the nodes and graph. Quickly navigate to different parts of the graph by clicking and dragging the mini map.

## Asset Browser
Use the Asset Browser panel to explore and manage assets in the active project and gems. Set up filters, select, create, rename, move, delete, and perform other operations on assets. The Asset Browser automatically selects the file corresponding to the most recently opened or activated document. This will only happen if the filters are set up to display the document type. Assets can be dragged from the Asset Browser into asset properties in the inspector and other windows supporting the dropped file types.

## Logging
The logging window displays a list of trace, warning, and error messages emitted since the application was launched.

## Python Terminal
Use the Python terminal to invoke script commands directly from within the application. It will also display the output, warnings, and errors from any Python code executed during the session.  Other views display available script commands and buses.

## Viewport
The viewport renders a scene containing a model, with the current material applied to it, under configurable lighting conditions. The viewport window has a toolbar with controls for setting different options related to the grid, shadow catcher, and tone mapping mode. There are also drop downs for selecting the viewport model, lighting preset, and render pipeline. Lighting presets contain all the settings for the skybox, image-based lighting, directional lights, and other settings used in the viewport. Since the introduction of the material pipeline system, render pipelines can also be changed at runtime.

## Viewport Settings
Use the viewport settings panel to edit the active lighting preset. The changes will be reflected in the viewport. Lighting presets can be selected, created, and saved from this panel. Model presets, which are sidecar files for identifying which models are available in the viewport, can also be managed from this panel. The viewport settings panel does not currently support undo/redo.
