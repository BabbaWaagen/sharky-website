# Debugging Shaders
More often than not, you might encounter shader compilation errors. This section goes over the tools and practices for debugging shaders in Atom.

Here are some basic debugging tips.

Shader Assets are processed by the Asset Processor. You can filter the assets by name, re-order them, and display detailed log for failed assets.

- Make sure the AP has the correct Root and Project set, the port is available (multiple instances of AP can't use the same port)
- Make sure the AP detects modifications to existing shaders - if you edit a line in any shader and save the changes, it should recompile successfully
  - Visit Computer Setup if any of the first two steps are not correct
- Assuming shaders compile normally, to debug a failing shader
  - Check the Log Details of the asset job. The shader assets pass through several tools and each of them emits detailed errors and warnings, but it might make it difficult to locate the actual fail. Make sure you are looking at the correct error
  - The temporary files for a failed asset can be found in the asset's temp folder - something like D:\lyengine\Atom\dev\AssetProcessorTemp\JobTemp-8hOGZZ\ Check your log to verify the correct name and open the folder
    - The .azslin file is the input file for AZSLc. It's emitted by preprocessing all includes with MCPP and is passed to azslc.exe. If you only see this file (or the others are empty), it's likely the AZSL compiler failed - you can copy-paste the .azslin contents to http://ec2-3-16-89-218.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/ (user:visitor pass:let me shade now) and edit it directly there to see where the error is
    - The various .json files are different reflection data - InputAssembly (.ia), OutputMerger (.om), BindingDependency, Options. Each of them is also generated by parsing the .azslin file with different command line attributes - --ia, --om, --options, --srg, etc. You can test the options too in the AZSL playground (http://ec2-3-16-89-218.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/ (user:visitor pass:let me shade now))
    - If you see the .azslcout file (or dx12.shaderresource - they're identical) that means AZSLc translated the source successfully, but the native shader compiler failed (dxc, spirv-cross, wave-psslc). You can copy-paste the contents to http://shader-playground.timjones.io/ (if it's dxc error) and verify it there.
  - The reported errors are correct, but the original file name and line numbers are likely off. There is a task to fix this
