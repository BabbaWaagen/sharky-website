Welcome to the Atom Documentation! The Atom renderer is the graphics engine powering the Open 3D Engine (O3DE). 


| Contents                        | Details |
|--------------------------------------|---------|
| [What is Atom?](what-is-atom.md) |  An introduction and high-level overview of Atom.  |
| [Setup and Installation](setup/installing-atom.md) |  Atom is already built into O3DE, but you can read about how to set up Atom as a standalone or across other platforms. <!-- Not sure if this section is even needed since it seems like Atom is in the same bundle as O3DE and follows the O3DE setup. --> |
| [Getting Started with Atom](get-started/_index.md) |  Explore how to create simple materials and shaders in Atom, or set up a 3D environment with Atom's rendering features in O3DE. |
| [Atom Sample Viewer](atom-sample-viewer/_index.md) |  Preview Atom’s rendering features through a series of samples, such as global illumination and multi-scene rendering.  |
| [Tutorials and Examples](tutorials/_index.md) |  Interact with a collection of tutorials and examples about rendering with Atom. |
| [Materials]() |  Learn about materials and material types that Atom provides. |
| [Textures]() |  Learn about textures and other image assets in Atom. <!-- Not certain what specific topics this will contain - it will need to be updated with a better description and title. --> |
| [Features]() |  Learn about graphics features and rendering techniques that Atom provides.  |
| [Developer Guide](core-systems/_index.md) |  Dive into Atom’s rendering pipeline and learn about its core systems and how they work together. |
| [Glossary](glossary.md) | A collection of terminology used in the Atom Documentation. |
