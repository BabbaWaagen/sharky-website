This section dives into the graphic feature samples demonstrated in the Atom Sample Viewer. 

<!-- [WRITER NOTE: Will need to restructure this. These samples are interactive might have properties to configure and document. Possible solution is to create a page for each sample and organize into sub-folders. As more features in Atom are developed, the list of samples will expand.] -->
