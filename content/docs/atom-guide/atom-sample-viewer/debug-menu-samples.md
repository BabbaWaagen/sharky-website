## CPU Profiler
The **CPU Profiler**, provides CPU timing information, which includes the time spent working on RHI threads and the time it takes for the GPU to finish its work. The timing is limited to static processes, meaning dynamic processes (such as passes and scopes) will be not be timed nor displayed. The values displayed are instantaneous and represent the timings from the frame prior to the rendering the values. 

To open the CPU Profiler choose `Profile` &rarr; `CPU Profiler`.
