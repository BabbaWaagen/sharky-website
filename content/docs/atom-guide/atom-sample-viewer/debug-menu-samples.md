This section dives into the debug menu samples demonstrated in the Atom Sample Viewer. 

<!-- [WRITER NOTE: Will need to restructure this. These samples are interactive might have properties to configure and document. Possible solution is to create a page for each sample and organize into sub-folders. As more features in Atom are developed, the list of samples will expand.] -->

## CPU Profiler
The **CPU Profiler**, provides CPU timing information, which includes the time spent working on RHI threads and the time it takes for the GPU to finish its work. The timing is limited to static processes, meaning dynamic processes (such as passes and scopes) will be not be timed nor displayed. The values displayed are instantaneous and represent the timings from the frame prior to the rendering the values. 

To open the CPU Profiler choose `Profile` &rarr; `CPU Profiler`.
