## Overview

O3DE uses the Open Asset Importer Library to do the heavy lifting of loading scene files from a variety of scene formats, including files in the `fbx` format.

## Building and updating the Open Asset Importer Library

The library is managed like all other external libraries for O3DE, via the 3p-package system. The source is available [here](https://github.com/o3de/3p-package-source/tree/main/package-system/assimp).

The general instructions for updating packages are available [here](https://github.com/o3de/3p-package-scripts).
