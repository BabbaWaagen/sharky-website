**Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** is a highly complex software product with many working parts. Just as an automobile comes with a user guide for drivers and a service manual for mechanics, O3DE benefits from having both a user guide for users and an engine guide for engine developers. The **Engine Developer Guide** is a place to document the architectural concepts that are too long or too broad for source code comments, and might be difficult to represent using words alone. The O3D community needs your help in documenting and explaining the inner workings and intra-workings of this modular, open source, 3D simulation engine. In this topic, you will learn what to include in this guide, where to place it in the directory structure, and what tools are supported on the website to help you best visually present your content.
