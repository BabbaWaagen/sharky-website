The architecture of the TIAF is broadly broken down into two areas: the [Automated Review Integration](./ar-integration), which concerns the integration of the TIAF runtime binaries into O3DE's automated review pipeline, and the [Runtime & Front End](./runtime-frontend), which concerns the architecture of the runtime and front end binaries that run the tests and present the results to the user.
