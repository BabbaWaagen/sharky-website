The **Test Impact Analysis Framework** (TIAF) is the implementation of change-based testing using a technique called [Fast Test Impact Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMzL1UCr0OE) for optimizing lead times of Automated Review. The TIAF currently supports both native (C++) tests and Python tests.
