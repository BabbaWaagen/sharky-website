***O3DE CLI***  is a package of tools and scripts containing functionality to interact with O3DE Objects. This includes registering engines, projects, gems, templates and downloading repositories with the o3de manifests. It also contains functionality for creating new projects, gems and templates as well as querying existing gems and templates and exporting projects. 

The development source for the CLI tools can be found here: https://github.com/o3de/o3de/tree/development/scripts/o3de. Sources for each of the CLI commands can be found in the nested [o3de folder](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/tree/development/scripts/o3de/o3de).
