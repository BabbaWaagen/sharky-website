**Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** includes many tools that support project development. Examples include **Asset Processor** (`AssetProcessor.exe`) and **Project Manager** (`o3de.exe`). This section of the Engine Developer Guide is for tools like these that are not part of any Gem. In these pages you will find detailed information and diagrams describing their architecture, for the benefit of developers who want to contribute to the O3DE project, or modify the tools to fit their needs.
