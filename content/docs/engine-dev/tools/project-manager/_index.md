***Project Manager*** is the entry point for many new users to O3DE. It is used to manage project creation and editing, building, downloading, among many other tasks. It also features templates for new projects, allowing you to easily create new objects as you need, without needing the CLI. Gems as well are managed through the Gem Catalog for any project.

The development source for the Project Manager can be found here: https://github.com/o3de/o3de/tree/development/Code/Tools/ProjectManager
