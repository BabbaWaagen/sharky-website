Open 3D Engine version 2111.1 is our first major release since launch! This release brings improved stability in the form of hundreds of bug fixes - over 700 tracked issues across nearly 2000 pull requests - as well as the first steps towards implementing critical features that will make building bigger, more beautiful simulations to life possible in O3DE. We're also happy to announce that O3DE is now considered stable on the Linux platform!
