After you create your sequence(s) and record animation data to them, you can use the **Node Pane**, **Track Editor**, and **Curve Editor** in the **Animation Editor** to modify your sequences.
+ In the **Node Pane**, you can add or remove UI elements from an animation sequence, edit sequences, and work with keys. For more information, see [Using the Node Pane](./using-node-pane).
+ In the **Track Editor**, you can limit your animation preview, manipulate keys, and change your animation's timeline. For more information, see [Using the Track Editor](./track-editor).
+ In the **Curve Editor**, you can manipulate splines to change the behavior of the transitions between keys. For more information, see [Using the **Curve Editor** in the UI Animation Editor.](./curve-editor).

You can use the toolbar to select a sequence to display and edit.

## Select an animation sequence to edit
+ In **Animation Editor**, click the arrow next to the name of the current sequence in the toolbar to display a list of active sequences available to edit.
