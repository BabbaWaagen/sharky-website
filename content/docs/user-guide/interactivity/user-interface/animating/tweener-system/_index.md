O3DE's Scripted Tweener Entity system is a script-driven animation system that creates powerful and flexible animations. To use this system, enable the [Scripted Entity Tweener](/docs/user-guide/gems/reference/script/scripted-entity-tweener) Gem.

The Scripted Tweener Entity system primarily animates entities in the **UI Editor**, and supports selected O3DE component entities, such as the [Transform](/docs/user-guide/components/reference/transform).

For a complete list, see [Tweener Supported Components](./tweener-components).
