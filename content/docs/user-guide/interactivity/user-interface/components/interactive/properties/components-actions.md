You can use the **Actions** properties to trigger a particular event when one of the listed actions occur. Type a string for one of the actions. When the listed action occurs (for example, when a game player starts to pause on the element), the listed string is sent as an action.

You can enter strings for the following actions:
+ **Hover start**
+ **Hover end**
+ **Pressed**
+ **Release**
