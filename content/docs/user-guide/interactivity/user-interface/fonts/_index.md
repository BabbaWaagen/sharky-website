You can add fonts to your game UI in O3DE by saving the font asset to your game project and creating an `.xml` file that contains specifics for that font, such as the path to the font file and parameters that affect the font's appearance. You can combine multiple font assets into a single font family and further customize text appearance using [Text Markup](/docs/user-guide/interactivity/user-interface/editor/components/components-text/#text-markup).

Using the procedures in this section, you can:
+ [Add new fonts to your game UI](./adding-fonts)
+ [Create font families](./create-font-families)
+ [Configure font rendering quality](./rendering)
