The following console variables can be used with the O3DE audio system.

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **s_ATLMemorySize** | Specifies in KB the size of the memory pool to be used by the audio translation layer (ATL). <br> Default values: PC = 8192, Mac = 8192, Linux = 8192, iOS = 8192, Android = 4096 |
| **s_AudioEventPoolSize** | Sets the number of preallocated audio events. <br> Default values: PC = 512, Mac = 512, iOS = 128, Android = 128 |
| **s_AudioLoggingOptions** | Toggles the logging of audio-related messages. Flags can be combined. <br> Values: a = Errors, b = Warnings, c = Comments <br> Default: ab (Errors and Warnings) |
| **s_AudioObjectsDebugFilter** | Filters debug drawing to only audio objects whose name matches a string. <br> Default: "" (all) <br> Example: `s_AudioObjectsDebugFilter=weapon_axe` |
| **s_AudioObjectPoolSize** | Sets the number of preallocated audio objects and corresponding audio proxies. <br> Default values: PC = 2048, Mac = 2048, iOS = 256, Android = 256 |
| **s_AudioProxiesInitType** | Can override on a global scale. If set, it determines whether AudioProxies initialize synchronously or asynchronously. This is a performance variable, as asynchronously initializing AudioProxies has a greatly reduced impact on the calling thread. When set to initialize asynchronously, audio playback is delayed. <br> Values: 0 = AudioProxy-specific initialization; 1 = Initialize synchronously; 2 = Initialize asynchronously <br> Default: 0 (all platforms) |
| **s_AudioTriggersDebugFilter** | Filters debug drawing to only audio triggers that match a string. <br> Default: "" (all) <br> Example: `s_AudioTriggersDebugFilter=impact_hit` |
| **s_DrawAudioDebug** | Draws AudioTranslationLayer related debug data to the screen. Flags can be combined. <br> Values: <br><ul><li>0: No audio debug info on the screen</li><li>a: Draw spheres around active audio objects</li><li>b: Show text labels for active audio objects</li><li>c: Show trigger names for active audio objects</li><li>d: Show current states for active audio objects</li><li>e: Show RTPC values for active audio objects</li><li>f: Show Environment amounts for active audio objects</li><li>g: Draw occlusion rays</li><li>h: Show occlusion ray labels</li><li>i: Draw sphere around active audio listener</li><li>v: List active Events</li><li>w: List active Audio Objects</li><li>x: Show FileCache Manager debug info</li><li>y: Show memory pool usage info for the audio impl</li></ul> Default: 0 <br> Example: `s_DrawAudioDebug abc` |
| **s_EnableRaycasts** | Set to `true`/`false` to globally enable/disable raycasting for audio occlusion & obstruction. <br> Default: true |
| **s_ExecuteTrigger** | Executes an Audio Trigger. <br> The first argument is the name of the audio trigger to be executed. <br> The second argument is an optional audio object ID. If the second argument is provided, the audio trigger is executed on the audio object with the given ID; otherwise, the audio trigger is executed on the global audio object. <br> Example: `s_ExecuteTrigger MuteDialog` <br> `s_ExecuteTrigger Play_chicken_idle 605` |
| **s_FileCacheManagerDebugFilter** | Allows for filtered display of the different AFCM entries such as Globals, Level Specifics, and Volatiles. Flags can be combined. <br> Values: a = Globals; b = Level Specifics; c = Game Hints; d = Currently Loaded <br> Default: 0 (all) |
| **s_FileCacheManagerMemorySize** | Sets the size in KB that the AFCM allocates on the heap. <br> Default values: PC = 393216, Mac = 393216, Linux = 393216, iOS = 2048, Android = 73728 |
| **s_IgnoreWindowFocus** | If set to `true`, the sound system continues to play when the Editor or Game window loses focus. <br> Default: false (off) |
| **s_LoadPreload** | Load an Audio Preload to the FileCacheManager. <br> Example: `s_LoadPreload GlobalBank` |
| **s_Microphone** | Turn on/off microphone input.  Uses Audio Input Source. <br> The first argument is 0 or 1 to turn off or on the Microphone. <br> The second argument is the name of the ATL trigger to use (when turning microphone on) for Audio Input. <br> Example: `s_Microphone 1 Play_audio_input_2D` <br> `s_Microphone 0` |
| **s_PlayExternalSource** | Execute an "External Source" audio trigger. <br> The first argument is the name of the audio trigger to execute. <br> The second argument is the collection Id. <br> The third argument is the language Id. <br> The fourth argument is the file Id. <br> Example: `s_PlayExternalSource Play_ext_vo 0 0 1` |
| **s_PlayFile** | Play an audio file directly.  Uses Audio Input Source. <br> The first argument is the name of the file to play. <br> The second argument is the name of the audio trigger to use. <br> Example: `s_PlayFile "sounds\my_file.wav" Play_audio_input_2D` |
| **s_PositionUpdateThreshold** | An audio object has to move by at least this amount to issue a position update request to the audio system. <br> Default: 0.1 (10 cm) |
| **s_RaycastCacheTimeMs** | Physics raycast results are given this amount of time before they are considered dirty and need to be recast. <br> Default: 250.0 |
| **s_RaycastMaxDistance** | Raycasts for obstruction/occlusion are not sent for sounds whose distance to the listener is greater than this value. <br> Default: 100.0 |
| **s_RaycastMinDistance** | Raycasts for obstruction/occlusion are not sent for sounds whose distance to the listener is less than this value. <br> Default: 0.5 |
| **s_RaycastSmoothFactor** | How slowly the smoothing of obstruction/occlusion values should smooth to target: `delta / (smoothFactor^2 + 1)`. <br> Low values will smooth faster; high values will smooth slower. <br> Default: 7.0 |
| **s_SetPanningMode** | Set the Panning mode to either 'speakers' or 'headphones'. Speakers will have a 60 degree angle from the listener to the L/R speakers. Headphones will have a 180 degree angle from the listener to the L/R speakers. <br> Default: speakers <br> Example: `s_SetPanningMode headphones` |
| **s_SetRtpc** | Sets an Audio Rtpc value. <br> The first argument is the name of the audio RTPC. <br> The second argument is the float value to be set. <br> The third argument is an optional audio object ID. If the third argument is provided, the RTPC is set on the audio object with the given ID. Otherwise, the RTPC is set on the global audio object. <br> Example: `s_SetRtpc volume_music 1.0` <br> `s_SetRtpc character_speed 0.0 601` |
| **s_SetSwitchState** | Sets an audio switch to a provided state. <br> The first argument is the name of the audio switch. <br> The second argument is the name of the switch state to be set <br> The third argument is an optional audio object ID. If the third argument is provided, the audio switch is set on the audio object with the given ID; otherwise, the audio switch is set on the global audio object. <br> Example: `s_SetSwitchState weather rain` <br> `s_SetSwitchState SurfaceType concrete 601` |
| **s_ShowActiveAudioObjectsOnly** | Determines whether only the active audio objects or all audio objects should be drawn when debug drawing is enabled. <br> Default: false (draw all audio objects) |
| **s_StopTrigger** | Stops an audio trigger. <br> The first argument is the name of the audio trigger to be stopped. <br> The second argument is an optional audio object ID. If the second argument is provided, the audio trigger is stopped on the audio object with the given ID; otherwise, the audio trigger is stopped on the global audio object. <br> Example: `s_StopTrigger MuteDialog` <br> `s_StopTrigger Play_chicken_idle 605` |
| **s_UnloadPreload** | Unload an Audio Preload from the FileCacheManager. <br> Example: `s_UnloadPreload GlobalBank` |
| **s_VelocityTrackingThreshold** | An audio object has to change its velocity by at least this amount to issue an `object_speed` RTPC update request to the audio system. <br> Default: 0.1 (10 cm/s) |
