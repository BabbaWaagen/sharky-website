description: Use NVIDIA PhysX to simulate rigid body physics, cloth, and create triggers in Open 3D Engine (O3DE).
---

**Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** provides several Gems that you can use to simulate physics. With the **PhysX** Gem you can create PhysX colliders for collision detection and rigid body simulation, triggers for script events, and force regions to localize forces such as wind. The **NVIDIA Cloth** Gem provides tools to simulate cloth and create cloth properties and constraints. The **PhysX Debug** Gem provides debugging and visualization tools for PhysX colliders and simulation.
