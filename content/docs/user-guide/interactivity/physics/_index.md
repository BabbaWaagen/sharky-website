O3DE's support for physics simulation is built around:

* [NIVDIA Blast](./nvidia-blast) to provide fast, high-fidelity destruction simulation.
* [NIVDIA Cloth](./nvidia-cloth) to support the creation of realistic cloth simulations.
* [NVIDIA PhysX](./nvidia-physx) for realistic physical effects such as collision detection and rigid body dynamics simulation.
