This guide covers how to use project export tooling to build and deploy games on Android. We will use the Android export script to generate a gradle project and prepare assets and then build the project. The end result of export should be an APK file that can be installed on your Android device, along with an additional step to auto-install on a connected phone.

## Prerequisites
1. Make sure that the [Project Export CLI Tool page](/docs/user-guide/packaging/project-export/project-export-cli) prerequisites are satisfied.
2. Make sure you have your project created and registered with your engine. Check that you can successfully build and open your project with the Project Manager.
3. Ensure all pre-requisites for working with Android in O3DE are satsified. You can learn about software dependencies [here](https://development--o3deorg.netlify.app/docs/user-guide/platforms/android/#prerequisite-software-and-packages) and project setup pre-requisites [here](https://development--o3deorg.netlify.app/docs/user-guide/platforms/android/generating_android_project_windows/#prerequisites). For the Android SDK, make sure to record where the root folder path is located on your hard drive, as that will be needed for setting up configuration.
4. Ensure that you have a proper keystore file configured for signing. You can learn more [here](https://development--o3deorg.netlify.app/docs/user-guide/platforms/android/#apk-signing). Here is an example keystore file you can create to start with (you will need the JDK with `keytool`):
```
export KEYSTORE_FILE_PATH=/path/to/android-key.keystore
export STOREPASS=o3depass
export ALIAS=o3dekey
export KEYPASS=o3depass
export KEYSIZE=2048
export VALIDITY=10000
export DNAME="cn=o3de-android-project, ou=o3de, o=LF, c=US"
keytool -genkey -keystore $KEYSTORE_FILE_PATH -storepass $STOREPASS  -alias $ALIAS -keypass $KEYPASS -keyalg RSA -keysize $KEYSIZE -validity $VALIDITY -dname $DNAME
```
5. Make sure the o3de engine bootstrap registry is enabled for android. To do so, go to your O3DE engine installation and edit the file at `$O3DE_ENGINE_PATH/Registry/bootstrap.setreg` so that the `assets` field uses `android`. Like so:
```
"assets": "android",
```
6. Edit the `$O3DE_ENGINE_PATH/Registry/AssetProcessorPlatformConfig.setreg` file at line 67 by uncommenting the line:
```
//"android": "enabled", -> "android": "enabled",
```
This will tell the asset processor to make sure ios assets are cached when building the project.

7. Make sure your project has the right configuration settings for Android. You can use the `android-configure` CLI tool to ensure this is setup. To see what is currently configured, run:
```
$O3DE_ENGINE_PATH/scripts/o3de.bat android-configure -l
```
You can also validate your current configuration using:
```
$O3DE_ENGINE_PATH/scripts/o3de.bat android-configure --validate
```
If you do not already have android configured, or encounter issues with the validate command, you can run the following:
```
$O3DE_ENGINE_PATH/scripts/o3de.bat android-configure --set-value platform.sdk.api=30
$O3DE_ENGINE_PATH/scripts/o3de.bat android-configure --set-value ndk.version=25.*
$O3DE_ENGINE_PATH/scripts/o3de.bat android-configure --set-value android.gradle.plugin=8.1.0
$O3DE_ENGINE_PATH/scripts/o3de.bat android-configure --set-value sdk.root=/path/to/android/sdk
$O3DE_ENGINE_PATH/scripts/o3de.bat android-configure --set-value signconfig.store.file=/path/to/android-key.keystore
$O3DE_ENGINE_PATH/scripts/o3de.bat android-configure --set-value signconfig.key.alias=o3dekey
$O3DE_ENGINE_PATH/scripts/o3de.bat android-configure --set-value asset.mode=PAK
```
Note that for sdk.root and signconfig.store.file, you must already know where those things exist on your hard drive, and use those paths accordingly. To setup the keypass and storepass, you must use the following commands
```
$O3DE_ENGINE_PATH/scripts/o3de.bat android-configure --set-password signconfig.store.password
$O3DE_ENGINE_PATH/scripts/o3de.bat android-configure --set-password signconfig.key.password
```
Make sure the passwords supplied here match what you used in the keystore file, and that you remember what they are.

## Quickstart
### Running the Export Script
For building in release mode with bundled PAK files for your APK, you can use the following export command:
```
export O3DE_ENGINE_PATH=/path/to/o3de
export PROJECT_PATH=/path/to/project
cd $PROJECT_PATH
$O3DE_ENGINE_PATH/scripts/o3de.sh export-project -es export_source_android.py -pp . -abp build/game-android -ll INFO --config release --asset-mode PAK
```

To use profile mode instead, change the `--config` parameter in the above snippet to use `profile` instead. If you wish to set the asset mode to LOOSE, use `--asset-mode LOOSE`.

That invocation should be all that is needed to create an APK file for your project. To install the APK on your phone for testing, this can be done by adding the `--deploy-to-android` flag in the export snippet above. Please note that to use this feature, you must ensure an android device is connected to your computer, and that ADB is able to properly access the device.

As a result of the export process, the resulting Android Gradle project folder was also generated. You can find it in `$PROJECT_PATH/build/game-android`. You can use this project folder from inside Android Studio to tweak any specific settings, or run the Debugger.

## Android Export Script
O3DE ships with an [Android Export Script](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/blob/bb3eafe30d8291f50b69924e5b7a432c8c6f53ca/scripts/o3de/ExportScripts/export_source_android.py#L28), capable of generating an Android Gradle project folder to handle standard use cases of O3DE projects on Android.

The export script has two primary sections: the function [`export_source_android_project`](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/blob/bb3eafe30d8291f50b69924e5b7a432c8c6f53ca/scripts/o3de/ExportScripts/export_source_android.py#L28) and the [startup code that only runs if the script is invoked by the CLI](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/blob/bb3eafe30d8291f50b69924e5b7a432c8c6f53ca/scripts/o3de/ExportScripts/export_source_android.py#L222). In-depth discussion on these two sections will be made in the [Developer Guide](https://docs.o3de.org/docs/engine-dev/) in the future.

### Usage
To use the export script, you can issue the arguments at the same time that you are running the `export-project` command. The arguments specific to the script will be deferred until it begins running.

The arguments are as follows:
| Argument Name | Description | Required? |
| - | - | - |
| [`--script-help`](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/blob/bb3eafe30d8291f50b69924e5b7a432c8c6f53ca/scripts/o3de/ExportScripts/export_utility.py#L120) | Display the help information specifically for the export script. | no |

| [`--seedlist`](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/blob/bb3eafe30d8291f50b69924e5b7a432c8c6f53ca/scripts/o3de/ExportScripts/export_utility.py#L156) | Path to a seedlist file for asset bundling. You can specify this multiple times for multiple seed lists. This parameter also allows for wildcard matching for paths. | no |

This will look in `<o3de_project_path>/Cache/levels` to fetch the right level prefab. Specify multiple times for each level in your game. This is not necessary if the level is already defined inside of a seed list. | no |
| [`--build-tools`](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/blob/bb3eafe30d8291f50b69924e5b7a432c8c6f53ca/scripts/o3de/ExportScripts/export_utility.py#L142) | Builds the O3DE toolchain executables if the engine is not an SDK.

Here is an example usage of this script:
```
# On Linux
export ANDROID_OUTPUT_PATH=/path/to/android/build/path
$O3DE_ENGINE_PATH/scripts/o3de.sh export-project --export-script $O3DE_ENGINE_PATH/scripts/o3de/ExportScripts/export_source_android.py --project-path $PROJECT_PATH --android-build-path $ANDROID_OUTPUT_PATH
```
`O3DE_ENGINE_PATH`, `O3DE_PROJECT_PATH` and `ANDROID_OUTPUT_PATH` are environment variables. The `O3DE_ENGINE_PATH` and `O3DE_PROJECT_PATH` variables point to the path locations for your o3de source engine and o3de project respectively. The `ANDROID_OUTPUT_PATH` variable corresponds to the folder path where you would like for the generated Android Gradle project folder to appear.
