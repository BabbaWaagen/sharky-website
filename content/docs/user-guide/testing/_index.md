Test automation is the process of writing small snippets of code (tests) to verify the desired functionality of Open 3D Engine (O3DE), and then having an automated process execute these tests regularly. You will use test automation to ensure quality and stability. 

[**Test Suites**](/docs/user-guide/testing/test-suites)

Test Suites tell processes, like automated review, which tests should be run when.

[**Test Runners**](/docs/user-guide/testing/test-runners)

Test runners collect tests, execute them and collate their results. We currently have three test runners in O3DE. GoogleTest, PyTest, and GoogleBenchmark.

[**Tools Packages**](/docs/user-guide/testing/tools-packages)

Tools packages are collections of useful functions and files to help you write tests quicker, safer, and more consistently. We currently have several tools packages, including: AzTest, EditorPythonTestTools, and LyTestTools.
