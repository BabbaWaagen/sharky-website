title: Tools Packages
---

Open 3D Engine (O3DE) offers several tools packages to make writing tests quicker, safer, and more consistent. Before you write tests, take time to familiarize yourself with the tools. Use them where appropriate to keep tests uniform across O3DE. Don't be afraid to add useful functionality to the tools themselves!

## AzTest

These are a collection of abstractions, functions, and wrappers to make writing C++ tests easier and more consistent.

## EditorPythonTestTools

These are a collection of test tools focused around accessing Editor functionality. Here is where you would want to start for tasks that you would expect a user of the Editor to perform.

## LyTestTools

LyTestTools are OS-level productivity tools, which simplify writing and debugging tests that across different environments. This includes (but is definitely not limited to) environment manipulation, creating/collecting images & logs, and starting launchers.
