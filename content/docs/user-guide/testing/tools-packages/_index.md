title: Tools Packages
---

We have several tools packages in Open 3D Engine (O3DE) to make writing tests quicker, safer, and more consistent. Before you write tests, you should familiarize yourself with the tools. Use them where appropriate to keep tests uniform across O3DE. Don't be afraid to add useful functionality to the tools themselves!

## EditorTestTools

These are a collection of test tools focused around accessing Editor functionality. Here is where you would want to start for tasks that you would expect a user of the Editor to perform.

## LyTestTools

LyTestTools are the broadest set of tools, covering most "shallow" operations. This includes (but is definitely not limited to) environment manipulation, creating/collecting images & logs, and starting launchers.
