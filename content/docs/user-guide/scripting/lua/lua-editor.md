The Open 3D Engine Lua Editor (Lua IDE) offers an intuitive integrated development environment (IDE) that makes it easy to author, debug, and edit Lua scripts when you create or extend your game. Lua Editor is a standalone application, but can be opened directly from the Open 3D Engine Editor using the Edit Mode Toolbar.
