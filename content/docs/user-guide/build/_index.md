To support multiple native build toolchains, **Open 3D Engine** (O3DE) uses the [CMake build tools](https://cmake.org/). While most configurable build systems make it difficult to work cross-platform, CMake is intentionally designed to take generic configuration files and generate toolchain-specific project files, and then perform native builds.

<!-- Link "created an O3DE project" to a project config section on creating projects? -->
 Once you've [registered O3DE](/docs/welcome-guide/setup) and [created an O3DE project](/docs/welcome-guide/create), you can build your project with these commands:

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab name="Windows" codelang="cmd">}}cd <project-directory>
cmake -B build/windows_vs2019 -S . -G "Visual Studio 16" -DLY_3RDPARTY_PATH=<absolute-path-to-packages>
cmake --build build/windows_vs2019 --target <ProjectName>.GameLauncher Editor --config profile -- -m
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab name="Linux" codelang="bash">}}cd <project-directory>
cmake -B build/linux -S . -G "Ninja Multi-Config" -DLY_3RDPARTY_PATH=<absolute-path-to-packages>
cmake --build build/linux --target <ProjectName>.GameLauncher Editor --config profile
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Builds created with these commands are located in the `<project-directory>/<build-directory>/bin/profile` directory.

Refer to [Configure and Build](configure-and-build) for a list of other build configurations.

O3DE requires CMake {{< versions/cmake >}} or higher.
