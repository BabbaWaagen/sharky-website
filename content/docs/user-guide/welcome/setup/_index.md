# Setting up Open 3D Engine {#setting-up-intro}

Open 3D Engine has a two\-part installation process:

1. The installer application downloads, extracts, and installs O3DE\.

1. Setup Assistant configures and installs additional software based on your development needs\. Jump right in to the O3DE Editor with an **Express Install** or customize O3DE's features for your development needs with a **Custom Install**\.
**Note**
To create and build new projects, or add gems to existing projects, either select **Custom Install** or run Setup Assistant again later to enable this functionality\.

After O3DE is installed, use Project Configurator to select a project or create a new project\. The following sections detail the minimum requirements for O3DE and guide you through the installation process\.
