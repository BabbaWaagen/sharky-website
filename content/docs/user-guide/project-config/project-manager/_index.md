**Project Manager** is a standalone application that helps you create, build, and configure Open 3D Engine (O3DE) projects. It provides a GUI-based front-end to the CMake build system and an alternative to many of the commands found in the [O3DE CLI](../cli-reference).

With Project Manager, you can do the following:

* Create a project, or add an existing project.
* Build a project.
* Open a project in **O3DE Editor**.
* Add or remove [Gems](/docs/user-guide/appendix/glossary#gem) in a project from the **Gem Catalog**.
* Configure the project icon.
* Configure engine manifest settings, such as default locations for projects,  downloadable ("third-party") packages, and other O3DE objects on your computer.
