## Programming with O3DE {#ly-programming-intro}

Learn about the game development APIs and integrations available with O3DE \(and for O3DE\)\. This documentation covers the EBus messaging infrastructure for in\-game communications between game systems, memory management and debugging, extending and customizing the O3DE editor and tools, networking, localization, and Twitch integration\.

These topics are for game developers who have experience with C\+\+ programming and common game design patterns\.
