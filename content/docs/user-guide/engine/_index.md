The *engine core* encompasses the source code, systems, and modules that underly **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** and its tools. All of these tools -- Editor, Asset Processor, Script Canvas, and so on -- work together to build an interactive 3D experience that uses modern rendering techniques and game play logic, and move your design from an empty scene to a fully polished project that you can deploy and share. In this section, you'll gain a deeper understanding in each part of the engine core and learn how you can expand O3DE's toolkit.

Start by learning how to navigate the O3DE directory structure and familiarize yourself with the core modules in the O3DE SDK (refer to [Overview of O3DE SDK](/docs/welcome-guide/key-concepts.md) in the Key Concepts). These modules are the entry points to all of the functionality in O3DE. As you proceed throughout this section, use an IDE of your choice to view the source code and refer to the [API Reference](/docs/api/) in the O3DE Documentation.

Depending on the part of the engine that you want to develop, there are different learning tracks that you can follow. While each learning track may be unique to your case, the following will get you started on some common developments:

- Developing a component
  
  - Component/Entity System
  
  - Event System
  
  - Introduction to C++ Programming
  
  - Programming for Component Development

- Developing a Gem
  
  - Gem Modules
  
  - Introduction to C++ Programming
  
  - Programming for Gem Development

- Developing an Atom Renderer feature
  
  - Atom Renderer Developer Guide
