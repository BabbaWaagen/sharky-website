The **PhysX Character Gameplay** component builds on top of the **[PhysX Character Controller](/docs/user-guide/components/reference/physx/character-controller/)** component. The components are separated so that the **PhysX Character Controller** component provides basic behavior which is expected to be more universal, while the **PhysX Character Gameplay** component provides example implementations of logic which is likely to be more game-specific, such as gravity.
