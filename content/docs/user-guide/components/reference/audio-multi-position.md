description: Use the Audio Multi-Position component to play sounds at multiple locations in Open 3D Engine.

The Audio Multi-Position Component helps to create sounds that emanate
from multiple locations. For example a sound that covers an area, like
a river, should use this component. Any sounds that have multiple
instances should also use this component, as it does help to reduce
resources.
