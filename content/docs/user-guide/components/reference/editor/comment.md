The **Comment** component allows you to add long-form text comments to component entities. When added to an entity, the Comment component displays a dialog box that expands based on the size of the comment. The following examples demonstrate how you can use the comment text box:
+ Explain how the scripts or components on an entity interact with other scripts or components.
+ Describe how everything in a level ties together.
+ Send descriptions, instructions, or notes to team members.
