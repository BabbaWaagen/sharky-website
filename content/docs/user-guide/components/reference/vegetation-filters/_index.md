Add vegetation filters to control the distribution of vegetation areas in your **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** level.

| Component | Description | 
| - | - |
| [Vegetation Altitude Filter](vegetation-altitude-filter) | Limits the placement of vegetation to be on surfaces within the specified height range. |
| [Vegetation Distance Between Filter](vegetation-distance-between-filter) | Defines the minimum distance required between vegetation instances. |
| [Vegetation Distribution Filter](vegetation-distribution-filter) | Limits the placement of vegetation to be within the specified value ranges. |
| [Vegetation Shape Intersection Filter](vegetation-shape-intersection-filter) | Limits the placement of vegetation to be on surfaces that intersect the specified shape. |
| [Vegetation Slope Filter](vegetation-slope-filter) | Limits the placement of vegetation to be only on surfaces within the specified surface angles. |
| [Vegetation Surface Mask Depth Filter](vegetation-surface-mask-depth-filter) | Limits the placement of vegetation to be on surfaces within a specified depth between two surface tags. |
| [Vegetation Surface Mask Filter](vegetation-surface-mask-filter) | Filters out vegetation based on surface mask-to-tag mappings. |
