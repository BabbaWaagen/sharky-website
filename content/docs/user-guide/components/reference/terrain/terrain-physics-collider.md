The **Terrain Physics Heightfield Collider** component provides terrain data to the physics system in the form of a heightfield and material assignments.  You can configure the dimensions of the collider by modifying the [Axis Aligned Box Shape Component](/docs/user-guide/components/reference/shape/axis-aligned-box-shape) on the same entity.

## Usage

You can assign which materials are assigned to surfaces, by selecting a surface type in the surface pull down menu, then selecting a physics material type in the material pull down.

## Provider

[Terrain Gem](/docs/user-guide/gems/reference/environment/terrain)

## Dependencies

[Axis Aligned Box Shape Component](/docs/user-guide/components/reference/shape/axis-aligned-box-shape)
