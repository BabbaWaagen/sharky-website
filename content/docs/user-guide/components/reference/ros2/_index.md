Refer to the [Robotics](/docs/user-guide/interactivity/robotics) documentation to learn more about robotics simulation features of O3DE.

ROS 2 Gem components can be divided into the following categories:
-  [Core components](core), essential to running simulations independent of the type of robot.
-  [Sensor components](sensors), responsible for creating and publishing data of simulated robot sensors.
-  [Control components](control), handling movement of mobile bases and robot arms due to control commands.
