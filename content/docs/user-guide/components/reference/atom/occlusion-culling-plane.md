The **Occlusion Culling Plane** component adds a plane, or an occluder, that when put between the camera and a mesh, can block the mesh from being rendered. Occlusion culling is a render culling technique that reduces the number of non-visible objects sent to the renderer. The occlusion culling technique determines whether to render an object or not by testing if the object is fully behind an occluder.
