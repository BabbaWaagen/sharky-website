The **Diffuse Global Illumination** component is a Level component that controls the quality level of all the Diffuse Probe Grid components, which adds global illumination to areas in the scene. Global illumination calculates the effect of light bounce, reflection, scatter, and absorption throughout an environment. It simulates real-world lighting behavior, where objects are lit both from the light source and from the light reflected by other objects.

| Property | Description | Values | Default |
|-|-|-|-|
| **Quality Level** | Sets the quality level of all Diffuse Probe Grid components in the scene. A higher quality level produces less artifacts and more fidelity, but is more expensive in terms of performance and memory.  | `Low`, `Medium`, `High` | `Low` |
