You can modify the engine settings registry file for **Asset Processor** in `Registry/AssetProcessorPlatformConfig.setreg` to perform the following tasks:

* Add new source asset types for Asset Processor.

* Update existing file type rules.

* Update the ignore list.

* Add or remove target platforms. The default value is the host platform. Asset Processor automatically builds assets for the host platform. For example, if Asset Processor is running on Windows, Asset Processor builds Windows assets even if pc is not enabled in the `.setreg file`.

* Add additional folders for Asset Processor to watch. For example, you can specify folders such as shared particle libraries and associated textures between projects.

* Set the number of process jobs.

* Specify which files trigger related files to be rebuilt. This is called *metafile fingerprinting*.

To add project-specific overrides, you can add an `AssetProcessorGamePlatformConfig.setreg` file to your projectsâ€™s `Registry` directory. This file is read after the engine `AssetProcessorGamePlatformConfig.setreg` configuration file and can have additional project-specific settings for the ignore list, platforms, and file types.
