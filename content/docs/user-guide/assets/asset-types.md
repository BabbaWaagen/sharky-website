The table below describes some of the most common source asset types supported by the **Asset Pipeline** in **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** and list the product assets generated by **Asset Processor** for each type.

{{< note >}}
Some source assets are simply copied to the **Asset Cache**, and so the product asset type is identical to the source asset type.

| Source Asset | Description  | Product Assets | 
| - | - | - |
| `.assetinfo` | A sidecar file that contains an asset processing configuration and settings for a source asset. `.assetinfo` files are source dependencies. If a `.assetinfo` file is modified, its corresponding source asset is reprocessed. | `.assetinfo` |
| `.bmp`</br>`.gif`</br>`.jpg`</br>`.jpeg`</br>`.png`</br>`.tga`</br>`.tif`</br>`.tiff` | Image file formats commonly used as textures for materials and UI elements. When processed, image files generate a streaming image product asset and might generate several mipmap product assets if mipmaps are selected. | `.streamingimage`</br>`.imagemipchain` |
| `.dds` | A specialized compressed image format most often used for normal maps and texture atlases. | `.streamingimage` |
| `.exr` | High dynamic range (HDR) images used for Image Based Lighting (IBL) and skyboxes. When processed, HDR image files generate a streaming image product asset and might generate several mipmap product assets if mipmaps are selected. | `.streamingimage`</br>`.imagemipchain` |
| `.fbx` | A scene file format that stores complete 3D scenes including meshes, skeletons, skin weights, animation, and materials. 3D scene source assets generate various product assets depending on the contents of the source asset and the data specified for processing. 3D scene files usually contain at least one mesh, and each mesh can produce over a dozen product assets including a model, a buffer for each of the model's vertex attributes, at least one material, and one PhysX mesh. | `.azmodel`</br>`.azlod`</br>`.azbuffer`</br>`.actor`</br>`.skinmeta`</br>`.motion`</br>`.pxmesh`</br>`.azmaterial` |
| `.gltf`</br>`.glb` |  An open source scene transport format that stores complete 3D scenes including meshes, skeletons, skin weights, animation, textures, and materials. 3D scene source assets generate various product assets depending on the contents of the source asset and the data specified for processing. 3D scene files usually contain at least one mesh, and each mesh can produce over a dozen product assets including a model, a buffer for each of the model's vertex attributes, at least one material, and one PhysX mesh.  | `.azmodel`</br>`.azlod`</br>`.azbuffer`</br>`.actor`</br>`.skinmeta`</br>`.motion`</br>`.pxmesh`</br>`.azmaterial` |
| `.gradimagesettings` | Contains properties that define an image gradient. | `.gradimagesettings` |
| `.inputbindings` | Binds input from keyboards, gamepads, touchscreens, and other devices to runtime events. | `.inputbindings` |
| `.postFXLayerCategories` | A list of key value pairs that define layers to which Post FX can be assigned. | `.postFXLayerCategories` |
| `.prefab` | A spawnable asset container that can include entities and/or other prefabs. | `.spawnable` |
| `.stl` | A simple mesh format used in computer aided design (CAD) and 3D printing. Unlike other 3D scene formats, `.stl` assets can only contain a simple model with limited vertex attributes. | `.azmodel`</br>`.azlod`</br>`.azbuffer`</br>`.pxmesh` |
| `.material` | Contains properties and values that define the look of a surface for rendering. | `.azmaterial` |
| `.physmaterial` | Contains properties and values that define the physical properties of a surface for simulation. | `.physmaterial` |
| `.scriptcanvas` | A Script Canvas graph created with Script Canvas Editor, which is O3DE's visual scripting tool. | `.scriptcanvas_compiled`</br>`.scriptcanvas_fn_compiled`</br>`.luac` |
| `.shader` | A program written in AZSL (O3DE's shader language) that calculates the shading of a surface. Shader assets are compiled when processed and produce several intermediate files and product assets for each supported target platform. | `.azshader`</br>`.azshadervariant`</br>`.hlsl`</br>`.json`</br> |
