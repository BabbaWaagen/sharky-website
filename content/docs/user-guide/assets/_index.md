Assets that are created in third-party digital content creation (DCC) tools or in Open 3D Engine (O3DE) must be processed to a runtime format for your project. The topics in this section introduce O3DE's asset pipeline, explain the tools used to export assets such as meshes and animation, and provide information so you can extend the asset pipeline to support you own workflows and asset types.

**In this section:**

| Topic Area | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [What's an Asset?](./overview) | An overview of O3DE's Asset Pipeline and an explanation of assets. |
| [Asset Pipeline](/docs/user-guide/assets/pipeline/) | Learn about the O3DE asset pipeline and asset builders. Asset builders convert your raw art, shaders, and other materials into runtime formats. |
| [Asset Processor](/docs/user-guide/assets/pipeline/processor/) | Learn how the O3DE Asset Processor tool manages and stores asset dependencies. |
| [Custom Asset Builders](/docs/user-guide/assets/pipeline/asset-system-programming/) | Learn how to create customer asset builders that support new or non-standard formats. |
| [Asset Bundler](/docs/user-guide/packaging/asset-bundler/) | Learn how the O3DE Asset Bundler can be used to manage and package your game assets for delivery. |
| [FBX Settings](/docs/user-guide/assets/fbx-settings/) | Learn how to use FBX Settings to export meshes, actors, motions and PhysX meshes for O3DE. |
| [Python Asset Builder](/docs/user-guide/assets/builder/) | Learn how to create custom asset builders with Python. |
