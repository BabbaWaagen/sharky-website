The table below describes some of the most common source asset types supported by the **Asset Pipeline** in **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)**.

| Asset file | Description  |
| - | - |
| `.bmp`, `.gif`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.tga`, `.tif`, `.tiff` | Image file formats most often used as textures for materials. |
| `.dds` | A specialized compressed image format most often used for normal maps and texture atlases in real-time applications. |
| `.exr` | High dynamic range images used for Image Based Lighting (IBL) and skyboxes. |
| `.fbx` | A scene file format that stores complex meshes with texture and color information, material assignments, skin weights, skeletons, animation, levels of detail, and physics colliders. |
| `.inputbindings` | Binds input from keyboards, gamepads, touchscreens, and other devices to runtime events |
| `.prefab` | A reusable, spawnable asset that contains entities or other prefabs. |
| `.stl` | A simple mesh format used in computer aided design (CAD) and 3D printing. |
| `.material` | Contains properties and values that define the look of a surface for rendering. |
| `.physicsmaterial` | Contains properties and values that define the physical properties of a surface for simulation. |
| `.scriptcanvas` | A Script Canvas graph created with Script Canvas Editor&mdash;O3DE's visual scripting tool. |
| `.shader` | A program written in AZSL (O3DE's shader language) that calculates the shading of a surface. |
