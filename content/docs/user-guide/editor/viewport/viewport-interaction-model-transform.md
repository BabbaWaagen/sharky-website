When you move the manipulator to another location in the viewport, you can modify the scale, rotation, or translation of the entity. This feature makes it easier for you to manage your entities.

**To modify the transform**

1. In the viewport, select an entity. The manipulator appears.

1. Click and drag the manipulator to transform the selected entity.

1. Press and hold **Ctrl**, and click and drag the manipulator to another location.

1. Use the manipulator again to adjust the scale, rotation, or translation of the entity.

In the following example, the manipulator is moved away from the car, switches to rotate mode, and rotates the car.
