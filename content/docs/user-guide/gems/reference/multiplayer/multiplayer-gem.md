**Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** ships with a **Multiplayer Gem** that uses the [O3DE networking stack](/docs/user-guide/networking/) to offer services used for multiplayer projects.

The Multiplayer Gem supports entity-based asynchronous networking in O3DE using event-driven network properties and remote procedure calls to synchronize O3DE components and entities across a network, giving you tools to make a multiplayer game.

The Multiplayer Gem includes the following features:

* Server authoritative model for anti-cheat
* Entity replication
* Push-based synchronization
* Event-driven network properties
* Reliable and unreliable remote procedure calls
* Local prediction
* Packet reconciliation
* Network input handlers
* Multiserver support

For information about working with the Multiplayer Gem, refer to the Networking section on [Multiplayer](/docs/user-guide/networking/multiplayer/).
