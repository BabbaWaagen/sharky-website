The **UR Robots Gem** provides simplified models of the following robotic arms developed by [Universal Robots](https://www.universal-robots.com/):
- [UR10](https://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur10-robot/)
- [UR20](https://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur20-robot/)
  
Thanks to the pneumatic vacuum end effector that can be attached to either of the arms (available in the Gem), you can use the assets in robotic simulations of warehouses. An example of such usage with [ROS&nbsp;2 Gem](./ros2.md) can be found in [ROSCon2023Demo](https://github.com/RobotecAI/ROSCon2023Demo). 

This Gem has a [Github repository](https://github.com/RobotecAI/o3de-ur-robots-gem/). For more information, refer to the _README_ file of the Gem.
