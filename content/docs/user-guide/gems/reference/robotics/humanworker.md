The Human Worker Gem provides a collection of animated human worker assets that can be used in robotic simulations with [ROS&nbsp;2 Gem](./ros2.md) in **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)**. The human worker can navigate between the waypoints in the scene and is visible to any robots that maneuver in the same area. It uses 

This gem contains the following components:
* Human worker mesh with textures
* Mesh animations of human standing
* Mesh animations of human walking
* O3DE components for basic navigation of the human worker in a scene

An example of its use can be found in [ROSCon2023Demo](https://github.com/RobotecAI/ROSCon2023Demo) project. The Gem is available from our [Github repository](https://github.com/RobotecAI/o3de-humanworker-gem). For more information, refer to the _README_ file of the Gem.
