{{< preview-migrated >}}

The Camera and Camera Framework Gems are a base upon which you can build more complex camera systems\. This gem contains the [Camera](/docs/user-guide/components/reference/camera/) and the [Camera Rig](/docs/user-guide/components/reference/camera-rig/), which work together to define a basic camera and its control rig\. You can customize the camera rig component through three different behaviors:
+ Target acquiring behavior
+ Target transform modifying behaviors
+ Final camera transform modifying behaviors
