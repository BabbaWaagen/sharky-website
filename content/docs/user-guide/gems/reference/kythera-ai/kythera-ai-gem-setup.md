Download the Kythera AI Gem .zip file from Kythera AIâ€™s website: https://www.kythera.ai/kythera-for-o3de.

# Build the Kythera AI demo project

The KytheraAIDemo project is part of the downloaded zip file.

Make sure you have a working engine installation from the installer or an SDK installation as documented here: [setup guide](/docs/welcome-guide/setup/).

1. Unpack the zip file to some folder
1. Open the O3DE Project Manager (`o3de.exe`)
1. Go to `New Project...` and select `Add existing Project`
1. Select the KytheraAIDemo folder in the unpacked zip folder
1. In the project menu, click `Build`<br>

1. There is an outstanding issue in the Engine that the Editor component of Kythera is not built automatically, so it has to be done manually for now:
    1. Open the generated Visual Studio solution `<unpacked zip>/KytheraAIDemo/build/windows_vs2019/KytheraAIDemo.sln`
    1. Switch build type from `debug` to `profile`
    1. Build the target `Kythera.Editor`, which is in one of the subdirectories matching the full filesystem path to the Gem
1. Back in the O3DE launcher, click `Open Editor`
1. After the Editor has launched, make sure that all assets have been processed in the Asset Processor (Status is Idle), otherwise opening our demo levels will throw errors

# Add the Kythera AI Gem to a project
The following steps work for both installed/SDK builds and engine centric builds:
1. Unpack the zip file to a folder
1. Open a command prompt/PowerShell window inside your engine installation
1. Run the following command: `.\scripts\o3de.bat register -gp <path to the Kythera Gem> --external-subdirectory-project-path <path to your game directory>`. This will add the `external_subdirectories` key to the `project.json` file and make the Gem available to your project.
1. Open the O3DE Project Manager (`o3de.exe`)
1. In the project menu, click `Edit Project Settings` and then the `Configure Gems` button on the top right corner
1. Kythera AI should now be selectable as a Gem. Select it and save the project settings.
1. There is an outstanding issue in the Engine that the Editor component of Kythera is not built automatically when using and SDK build, so it has to be done manually for now:
    1. Open the project's Visual Studio solution (`<project directory>/build/windows_vs2019/<project name>.sln`)
    1. Switch build type from `debug` to `profile`
    1. Build the target `Kythera.Editor`, which is in one of the subdirectories matching the full filesystem path to the Gem
