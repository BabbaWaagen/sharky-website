Download the Kythera AI Gem .zip file from Kythera AI’s website: https://www.kythera.ai/kythera-for-o3de.

## Build the Kythera AI demo project

The KytheraAIDemo project is part of the downloaded zip file.

Make sure Open 3D Engine (O3DE) is set up according the [setup guide](/docs/welcome-guide/setup/).
Building the project with the SDK version of the engine is not supported yet, so the step for building the engine as an SDK can be skipped.

1. Unpack the .zip file into a directory. For this example, we’ll use `C:\dev\kythera`. If you use a different path, substitute `C:\dev` with the full path to the directory containing the Kythera AI Gem.

1. Create a `build` directory in the unpacked `KytheraAIDemo` directory (`C:\dev\kythera\KytheraAIDemo\build`).

1. Open a command prompt and `cd` into the build directory.

1. Run the following cmake configuration command, substituting the correct paths (do not use trailing slashes when specifying the paths):

    ```cmd
    cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16" -DLY_3RDPARTY_PATH=<3rdParty cache path> -DLY_EXTERNAL_SUBDIRS=<path to unpacked zip/Gems/Kythera> -DLY_UNITY_BUILD=ON
    ```

1. In Visual Studio, open the generated solution `KytheraAIDemo.sln`.

1. Set `Code/Editor/Editor` as your startup project.

1. Switch the build configuration to `profile`

1. Build and run the Editor project. The KytheraAIDemo project contains the KytheraCity level which demonstrates 2D and 3D navigation, navigation splines and behavior trees.

## Add the Kythera Gem to a project

1. Create a new project following the guide to [Project Creation with O3DE](/docs/welcome-guide/create).

1. Add `Kythera` to your project's `enabled_gems.cmake` file, which can be found in the `Code` subdirectory of the project.

1. Run the cmake configuration command and add the Kythera Gem directory as an external subdirectory:

    ```cmd
    cmake -B MyProject/build -S MyProject -DLY_EXTERNAL_SUBDIRS=<path to unpacked zip>\Gems\Kythera`
    ```

1. Rebuild the project from within Visual Studio.
