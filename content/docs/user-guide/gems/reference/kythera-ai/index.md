# Kythera AI Gem

The Kythera AI Gem furnishes O3DE with a broad toolset of AI features. It comes with a demo project, ShooterDemo, containing levels which use these features. This documentation gives an outline of the AI tools currently available through the Kythera AI Gem.

The Gem is available from our website at [https://kythera.ai/o3de](https://kythera.ai/o3de).

As O3DE itself evolves, we plan to keep developing our Gem -- and this documentation -- to include the full range of Kythera AI features.
