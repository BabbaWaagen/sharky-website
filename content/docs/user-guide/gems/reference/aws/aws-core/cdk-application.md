The [Cloud Development Kit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html) (CDK) is a software development framework from AWS for defining cloud infrastructure for your project and provisioning it through **AWS CloudFormation**.

The AWS Core Gem includes an optional Python CDK application that provides two stacks:

1. A core stack to use as the basis for a project's CDK application.
1. An example stack with example resources that can be connected to **ScriptBehavior** samples in Core.

The Python project is set up like a standard Python project. The initialization process uses virtual environments, created with `virtualenv` and stored under the `.venv` directory.

To create the virtual environment, you must have a `python3` executable (or `python` for Windows) in your path with access to the `venv` package. If the automatic creation of the `virtualenv` fails, you can create the `virtualenv` manually.

## Prerequisites

* AWS credentials configured. Refer to the steps shown in [Configuring AWS Credentials](./configuring-credentials.md).
* [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_install) (CDK) installed.
* O3DE project built.

## Working with the CDK application

There are a few one-time set up steps to prepare for your first CDK deployment. The following commands should all be run from the `cdk` directory of the Gem you're working with.

### 1. Set up Python environment

_For the latest instructions, refer to the `README.MD` located in `<engine root>\Gems\AWSCore\cdk`._

Open a command prompt to the `cdk` directory of the Gem you're working with.

```cmd
cd <ENGINE_ROOT>\Gems\<AWS_GEM>\cdk
```

* Example when deploying the CDK application for AWS Core:

    ```cmd
    cd <ENGINE_ROOT>\Gems\AWSCore\cdk
    ```

Create a `virtualenv`.

```cmd
# Windows
python -m venv .venv

# Mac or Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Activate your `virtualenv`.

```cmd
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Mac or Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required dependencies.

```cmd
# Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Mac or Linux
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set environment variables or accept defaults

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `O3DE_AWS_DEPLOY_REGION` | The region to deploy the stacks into, will default to CDK_DEFAULT_REGION. |
| `O3DE_AWS_DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` | The account to deploy stacks into, will default to CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT. |
| `O3DE_AWS_PROJECT_NAME` | The name of the O3DE project that stacks should be deployed for, will default to AWS-PROJECT. |

See [Environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/environments.html) in the AWS CDK Developer Guide for more information including how to pass parameters to use for environment variables.

### 3. Bootstrap the environment

The AWS environment needs to be bootstrapped because this CDK application uses assets in a local directory that contains handler code for the AWS Lambda functions.

Use the CDK `bootstrap` command to bootstrap one or more AWS environments.

```cmd
cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNT-NUMBER-1/REGION-1 aws://ACCOUNT-NUMBER-2/REGION-2 ...
```

For example:

```cmd
cdk bootstrap aws://123456789012/us-east-1
```

See [Bootstrapping](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/bootstrapping.html) in the AWS CDK Developer Guide for more information about the bootstrap provisioning process.

### 4. Synthesize the project

At this point you can now synthesize the AWS CloudFormation template. Use the CDK `synth` command from the `cdk` directory of the Gem whose application you are deploying.

```cmd
cdk synth
```

To add additional dependencies, such as other CDK libraries, just add them to your `requirements.txt` file and rerun the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command.

### 5. Deploy the project

To deploy the CDK application, use the CDK `deploy` command from the `cdk` directory of the Gem whose application you are deploying.

```cmd
cdk deploy
```

The deploy command displays progress information as your stack is deployed.

## Useful commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `cdk ls` | List all stacks in the app.
| `cdk synth` | Emits the synthesized CloudFormation template. |
| `cdk deploy` | Deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region. |
| `cdk diff` | Compare deployed stack with current state. |
| `cdk docs` | Open CDK documentation. |
