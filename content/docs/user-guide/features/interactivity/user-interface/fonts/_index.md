# Implementing New Fonts {#ui-fonts}

You can add fonts to your game UI in Lumberyard by saving the font asset to your game project and creating an `.xml` file that contains specifics for that font, such as the path to the font file and parameters that affect the font's appearance\. You can combine multiple font assets into a single font family and further customize text appearance using [Text Markup](/docs/userguide/ui/editor/components-text#ui-editor-component-text-styling-markup)\.
