# Visibility {#gems-system-gem-visibility}

You can enable the Visibility gem for your game project so that you can add the **[VisArea](/docs/user-guide/features/components/vis-area.md)** component to an entity\. You can use the component to create a visibility area \(vis area\) that helps manage visibility and culling in a scene\.
