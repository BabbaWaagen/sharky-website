# Camera Framework Gem {#gems-system-gem-camera}

The Camera and Camera Framework Gems are a base upon which you can build more complex camera systems\. This gem contains the [Camera](/docs/user-guide/features/components/camera.md) and the [Camera Rig](/docs/user-guide/features/components/camera-rig.md), which work together to define a basic camera and its control rig\. You can customize the camera rig component through three different behaviors:
+ Target acquiring behavior
+ Target transform modifying behaviors
+ Final camera transform modifying behaviors
