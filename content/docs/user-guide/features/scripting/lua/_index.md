You can use Lua in O3DE to facilitate quick iteration of your game project\. Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language\. When you construct new gameplay and game systems, you can run your changes immediately, without compiling your source code\.

## Learning Lua {#lua-scripting-resources-general}

For learning the Lua language itself, the [lua\.org](http://www.lua.org) website is a good place to start\.
+ [Official Lua Documentation](http://www.lua.org/docs.html) - Provides a central location for information about Lua, including a [Getting started](http://www.lua.org/start.html) page\.
+ [Programming in Lua](http://www.lua.org/pil/) - This text is a resource for getting started with Lua programming\.
+ [Lua 5\.1 Reference Manual](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/) - Provides a reference of all the functions that are available by default in Lua\.

## Learning Lua in O3DE {#lua-scripting-resources-ly}

After you read through this tutorial on writing Lua scripts for the component entity system, learn more about using Lua in O3DE by consulting the following resources\.
+ For information on O3DE's built\-in Lua editor, see [Lua Editor](/docs/user-guide/features/interactivity/scripting/lua/debugging.md)\.
+ For sample Lua [scripts](/docs/userguide/ly-glos-chap#scripts), see the O3DE `\dev\SamplesProject\Scripts` directory and its subdirectories\.
+ For information about Lua API operations in O3DE, see the [Component Entity Lua API Reference](/docs/userguide/scripting/lua/api.md)\.
+ For information about the O3DE EBus, see [Working with the Event Bus \(EBus\) system](/docs/user-guide/features/engine/ebus)\.
