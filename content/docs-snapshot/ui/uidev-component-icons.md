# Lumberyard component icons<a name="uidev-component-icons"></a>

This page contains an organized collection of icons currently used by Lumberyard component cards\. Use the following chart to help you find an icon\.

The component icons have been categorized into color categories to help you understand which content segment they belong to\. Not all of our icons will be posted here, however if you need a new one or are looking for an icon resource that is not here, please reach out to [lumberyard\-ux@amazon\.com](mailto:lumberyard-ux@amazon.com) and we will get back to you promptly\.

Please note that all component icons need to fit within one of the 14 component categories\. When requesting an icon, indicate which category your new icon should belong to\. If your feature creates an entirely new category, consult with the [Lumberyard UX team](mailto:lumberyard-ux@amazon.com) to find color variations that fit within the color schema\.
