## FBX Settings overview<a name="fbx-properties-overview"></a>

With **FBX Settings** you can customize how **Asset Processor** exports your `.fbx` files as runtime assets\. **FBX Settings** presents options based on the contents of the selected `.fbx` file\. 

![\[The FBX Settings tool interface.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/images/fbx/ui-fbx-settings-A-1.25.png)

Your `.fbx` files can contain any number of assets\. You can create a single `.fbx` file that contains multiple characters, with LoDs, and animations, or a single `.fbx` file containing all the vegetation assets required for a level\. When these assets are processed they appear as children of the `.fbx` file in **Asset Browser**\.

## Modify FBX Settings<a name="fbx-properties-modify"></a>

1. In **Lumberyard Editor**, in **Asset Browser**, select the `.fbx` file to modify\. 
**Tip**  
Enter **fbx** into **Asset Browser**'s search bar to find `.fbx` files\. 

1. Right\-click the `.fbx` file and then choose **Edit Settings**\.

1. There are four possible tabs in **FBX Settings**\. The available tabs depend on the contents of the `.fbx` file: 
   + **Meshes** \- In the **Meshes** tab, you can create groups and modify export settings for meshes\. Exported mesh data is stored in a `.cgf` file\. 

     The **Meshes** tab is available if the `.fbx` file contains meshes\. 
   + **Actors** \- In the **Actors** tab, you can create groups and modify export settings for actors\. An actor has a skeleton and a skinned mesh, but is not necessarily a character\. Any asset containing at least one bone is an actor\. Actor data is stored in a `.actor` file\. 

     The **Actors** tab is available if the `.fbx` file contains at least one bone\. 
   + **Motions** \- In the **Motions** tab, you can modify export settings for animation\. Animation data is stored in a `.motion` file\. 

     The **Motions** tab is available if the `.fbx` file contains at least one bone with animated channels\. 
   + **PhysX** \- In the **PhysX** tab, you can create groups and modify export settings for PhysX collider assets\. You set properties to automatically fit primitive or generate convex collider assets based on meshes contained in the `.fbx` file\. PhysX collider data is stored in a `.pxmesh` file\. 

     The **PhysX** tab is available if the `.fbx` file contains meshes\.
**Note**  
To use PhysX collider assets, you must have the PhysX Gem enabled in your project\. 

1. The **Meshes**, **Actors**, and **PhysX** tabs can have multiple groups, each with their own modifiers\. Each group creates separate runtime asset files\. To add groups, choose the **Add another\.\.\.** button at the top of the tab\. To add a modifier to a group, choose the **Add Modifier** button in the **Modifiers** section of the group and select a modifier from the list\. 

1. The **Motions** tab exports animations individually and creates a `.motion` file for each animation\. To add motions, choose the **Add another motion** button at the top of the tab\. To add a modifier to a motion, choose the **Add Modifier** button in the **Modifiers** section of the motion, and select a modifier from the list\. 

1. To remove a modifier, motion, or group, choose the **X** button for the entry\. 

1. Choose **Update** to apply your changes\. A `.assetinfo` file containing your modified FBX settings is generated or the existing `.assetinfo` file is updated\. **Asset Processor** automatically exports the data from your `.fbx` files\. Some `.fbx` files might take longer to process depending on file size, complexity, and selected options and modifiers\. 

1. Review the status for errors or a success message\. To return to the settings, choose **OK**\.

The exported runtime assets appear as children of the `.fbx` file in **Asset Browser**\.
