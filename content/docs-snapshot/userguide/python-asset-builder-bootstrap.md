# Create or modify a bootstrap script<a name="python-asset-builder-bootstrap"></a>

To make your Python Asset Builder script available to the asset processing system, you must add a `bootstrap.py` file to the path or modify an existing `bootstrap.py` file\. We recommend you use a location that is relative to where your Python Asset Builder scripts will be stored, such as one of the following: 
+ `lumberyard_version\dev\MyProject\Editor\Scripts\bootstrap.py` 
+ `lumberyard_version\dev\Gems\MyGem\Editor\Scripts\bootstrap.py` 

To add your Python Asset Builder, import it in the `bootstrap.py` file\. 

```
import asset_builder_my_asset_type
```

The above example assumes that the Python Asset Builder is named `asset_builder_my_asset_type.py`, and that it's in the same directory as the `bootstrap.py` file\.
