| This feature is in [preview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/userguide/ly-glos-chap.html#preview) release and is subject to change\.  | 

 With **NVIDIA Cloth** in Amazon Lumberyard you can create realistic cloth simulations for entities that contain **Actor** or **Mesh** components\. The **NVIDIA Cloth** gem provides a component you can use to simulate cloth on any mesh that has been processed with a **Cloth** modifier applied in **FBX Settings**\. 

To use **NVIDIA Cloth** you must enable the [NVIDIA Cloth gem](nvidia-cloth.md)\. 

## NVIDIA Cloth features<a name="nvidia-cloth-features"></a>

****
+ Apply cloth data to meshes imported from `.fbx` files\. 
+ Add cloth simulation to entities containing **Mesh** and **Actor** components\. 
+ Cloth mesh simplification and static triangle removal allow you to use complex cloth meshes and yield faster cloth simulation\. 
+ Define **Inverse mass**, **Motion constraints**, and **Backstop** per cloth particle with vertex color streams you create\. 
+ Blend between cloth simulation and actor keyframe animation with motion constraints\. 
+ Add cloth colliders to actors with **Animation Editor**\. 
+ Add local wind forces to your cloth simulations or use force regions to simulate wind\. 
+ Simulate cloth in parallel across available CPU cores, or simulate cloth on a discrete GPU that supports NVIDIA CUDA \(Windows 10 only\)\. 
+ **NVIDIA Cloth** gem's public API allows other systems and gems to access cloth simulation functionality\. 
+ Debug cloth simulations and constraints with real\-time cloth debug visualizations\.
